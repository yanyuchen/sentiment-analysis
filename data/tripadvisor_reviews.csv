Alcatraz Island,Amber N W,None,None,5,FUN FOR ALL AGES,Mar,2023,My family took the tour ( BUY TICKETS IN ADVANCE)! We have 2 small boys and an infant. It wasn't difficult at all to maneuver with our stroller and we made the trek with all children. The ferry is clean and peaceful with snack for purchase ( we purchased 4 hotdogs and drinks in advance). The boat bathroom is clean and appropriate for all needs. The island also has clean and appropriate facilities. There are steep hills but we are an active family so we didn't struggle with this. The audio tour was appropriate for all children and we enjoyed it as well. This was not only educational but also a lifelong memory made with our family! 110% recommend!,5.0
Alcatraz Island,Gord P,None,None,16,great tour,Feb,2023,This is a must stop if you are in San Fran!!! We did the audio tour and was very interesting!!! We were going to do ther night tour but didnt book far enough in advance!! Should book night tour a week in advance.,5.0
Alcatraz Island,Jess,None,None,4,Must See,Mar,2023,I did not expect to enjoy the tour as much as I did. The recorded tour was very informational and done very well. I often do not listen to these type of tours as they are boring but this one held my attention. Definitely recommend this tour.,5.0
Alcatraz Island,Christine J,None,None,13,Unsafe area DO NOT GO!,Mar,2023,San Francisco is completely unsafe. We bought tickets for Alcatraz. We drove around trying to find parking. Found a place. Gangs were patrolling the area. Windows were smashed out of cars. We were right in front of pier 33. We couldn’t even go on the tour because the thought of getting our window smashed and everything inside taken. I asked around. This is a common occurrence. No police anywhere. Mind you this is middle of daylight hours. Unbelievable that the city has been destroyed by crime. I would never return. I didn’t get a refund for our tickets.,1.0
Alcatraz Island,Yankeehoya,Doha,Qatar25,8,No Additional Tour Guide Needed,Mar,2023,"I had a 13-hour layover in San Francisco And I wanted to do something with a lot of fresh air to keep me awake after a no-sleep flight from Asia. The Alcatraz tour filled that bill nicely. I was originally going to take a guided tour that cost $150, but they were all booked up. Glad I did not. This tour was a third the price. Given the excellent audio guide, the Park Rangers, and enthusiastic docents, there was no reason to pay for an additional guide. $50 is still kind of expensive, especially if you have children, but it does include the boat ride which was lovely.",4.0

Alcatraz Island,Schatze,Chicago,IL23,7,A Must-See while in SF,Nov,2022,My friends and I did the day-time tour of the island and it was FANTASTIC. There is so much history I wasn't aware of - you learn a lot. You can do as much guided/unguided as you want. I also didn't realize how beautiful the island is - the grounds are very well kept and the gardens are stunning. It's a GREAT spot for birdwatching - I had 3 lifers while on the island!,5.0

Alcatraz Island,MOM282013,Elkhart,IN1,2,Go or don’t,Feb,2023,"$50 is a little pricey for the self guided tour. You pay for the ferry ride and the recorded tour, but worth maybe $30 not &50. The room talking about change within our prison systems, I hope my booking supports some of that! Was worth the trip, we had a good time I just thought the price was a little much for the lack of doing on the human side of things. Could of gone with or without the tour, was something to do.",3.0

Alcatraz Island,pearx4,Stafford,VA62,8,Fabulous Alcatraz Experience,Feb,2023,"What a fun experience! Took the 10:15 Ferry from Pier 33. Ferry was well equipped with snacks, beverages, and restrooms. Ride was 15-20 minutes. Spectacular views of the island can be captures on the way. When disembarking, there is a Park Ranger giving short instructions then you are off to climb to the top of the rock! Pick up your audio tour and enjoy the history and fascination of this historical place. We learned a lot and thoroughly enjoyed walking all over the grounds. We were lucky to take in a FREE guided tour that allowed entry into areas otherwise blocked off. From the lighthouse, the San Francisco Cityscape is amazing. You can also take in both Golden Gate and Bay bridges. Don't miss seeing the lovely gardens and landscaping as well as the numerous species of nesting birds. The gift shop is reasonably priced and has pretty much any souvenir you might want. While the buildings may be old and hold many not so positive stories, Alcatraz Island is beautiful. Recommend planning to make this your only stop for the day, as to see and enjoy, you need 4-5 hours to take it all in. Can be done in a shorter amount of time but why rush. Note - only bottles of water are allowed on the island and large backpacks are not permitted. Cost was very well worth the price!",5.0
Alcatraz Island,ZCC,Fife,UK14,7,A must see whilst in San Francisco!,Feb,2023,Booked on the 9.45 ferry but arrived earlier than expected which turned out perfect timing as we were allowed to board the first ferry of the morning - which was nice and quiet. Great views of Alcatraz from the ferry and even better views from the island itself. The cell house audio tour is an absolute must. The only downside was some of the island was closed off.,5.0

However, I found that everything was REALLY well done. The tour noted the hardships of being in jail without glorifying them and there was even an exhibit about how incarnation effects modern society. Definitely give yourself the time to walk around and explore the whole island as there were details and additional information that I would have missed if I just did the tour and then hopped back on the ferry.",5.0

Alcatraz Island,Aaron Shelby,Abu Dhabi,United Arab Emirates10,4,A Dynamic Trip,Jul,2022,"My friends and I took the first ferry of the morning to reach Alcatraz Island and it was worth it. We cruised through the legendary SF fog to reach the island and when we arrived we were greeted with the remnants of the Indigenous people's occupation of the island. I am glad that the NPS did not try to brush over this part of the history of the island and people of the country. The island is sizable and accessible by foot. Make sure to pack warm clothes because it is quite cool and windy there. The prison itself has a guided audio tour with various stop points throughout the building to get a sense of the history of the people and location. Additionally, there was a fascinating exhibit about the occupation in an industrial building on the north side of the island. I learned a lot about the occupation through the images and words shared by the people who were there. Alcatraz is easily a half-day experience. Make sure to book your tickets ahead of time in order to have the experience you want. It is definitely a visit you should make if you're in the bay area.",5.0

São Francisco acabou, lamentavelmente ! Estacionei num “public parking” no Pier 33 por U$ 35. Havia placas orientando não deixar pertences no carro, com fotos de vidros de carros quebrados. Um verdadeiro atestado de incompetência da gestão pública ! Achei que não seria possível que acontecesse, num estacionamento pago, às 9 horas da manhã. Pois bem, quando retornei ao meio-dia, vários carros estavam com seus vidros quebrados, inclusive o meu ! Levaram mala e mochila, com muitos pertences. Pra piorar, a polícia disse que, sem nenhuma violência física, nada faria, e que eu deveria fazer um registro online. Califórnia nunca mais…",4.0
Alcatraz Island,BRPBTLC8,San Diego,California,7,BRPBTLC,Jan,2023,"Being in S. F. on the off-season. No lines, hardly anyone out-n-about. So basically anywhere we went, we didn't encounter wall-to-wall folks or lines. It was fabulous. Shops, restaurants, walking, biking were all easily managed without bumping into lots of folks. Luv'd it. Only line we stood in was prior to boarding the ferry to Alcatraz which was understandable. However, that said, the line went quickly. And bc it was not full to capacity, we were able to board the earlier scheduled departure time. Our departure time was 1:40p, but we actually boarded w the 12:30p grp. That was a plus in itself. Ferry ride was comfortable. They have snacks & restrooms on board. It was about a 15 min actual ride once we were all on board. Plenty of seating. Alcatraz itself was amazing. A lot of history there. The staff were top notch! Very professional and informative. Be sure to dress in layers and wear yr comfortable walking shoes. A lot of up and down walking. It was a wonderful experience over all from start to finish. Would absolutely recommend visiting. Be sure to go online well in advance of yr trip to secure yr tickets. Even though our dates were off-season, the tickets were being snatched up. I did find out how easy it was to cancel and change our dates slightly as we were initially concerned about all the rain, flooding, etc on the news days before. But i kept in constant contact directly w the hotel. Also, there is no need to print out the tickets as long as u receive the QR code on yr phone. Then prior to boarding, u can just show yr QR code on your phone and u r good to go. It all worked out in the end.",5.0

Alcatraz Island,yiannava,Nicosia,Cyprus2,9,A chilly experience,Dec,2022,Book your tickets in advance so that you avoid disappointment. The tours to Alcatraz are indeed very popular and rightly so. Book through the official site of Alcatraz. It is much cheaper. The Forrest Rangers and volunteers do the guided tours on the island and provide useful information. Buy the self guided audio. The narrative pace is excellent. Allows you to see everything at an easy pace. Reaching the prison from the dock is uphill and can be a little strenuous but there is a small electric cart that gives a free ride to the top for those who need it.,5.0

This time I planned more carefully than usual, and booked the behind the scenes tour. I am very glad I did. First, it’s a small group (20-30) and you have an outbound ferry all to yourselves. The ranger led tour begins as soon as you get on the island, and included access to the industry building, hospital, chapel, gun galleries and dungeons - areas I have not been able to see before. You take the usual audio tour of the cell house, but after most of the crowds have dissipated (just with the night tour folks). After that, you can stay on for the night tour ranger led activities, which bring you back to the dock ready for the 6.40 or 7.40 pm return ferries. Definitely worth springing for behind the scenes tour tickets if you can get them.",5.0

Alcatraz Island,thomassH263XQ,Chicago,IL3,9,BEHIND THE SCENES TOUR - Not worth the money or time,Nov,2022,"My sister and I had booked a ""BEHIND THE SCENES TOUR"" through Viator. Upon arrival at Alcatraz, we had a group of about 15 people. We were directed to National Park Service docents, three in all. What we didn't realize was that upon arrival at Alcatraz, you can just wander around by yourself. The primary docent had started with a story about Native Americans taking over the Island in the later 1960's...way too much detail on this topic. The group started up the hill towards the water tank and morgue and this docent starts up again with the minutae regarding the Native Americans taking over the Island in the later 1960's....on and on and on. BORING. My sister and I made our way AWAY from the group, did a self-conducted tour, returned to Sausalito on an earlier ferry and had a wonderful meal at The Spinnaker. The moral of the this story...the so-called ""behind the scenes tour"" was going to take several hours. If you're OK with walking around by yourself, you will be fine.",3.0

Alcatraz Island,lm55417,Minneapolis,MN28,4,Great Tour,Nov,2022,"I did this tour over 30 years ago and I'm glad I did it again. It's such a fascinating place with an incredible history. There is a self-guided audio tour that you can do at your own pace - granted you can get around the mass of people. You can then explore the rest of the property at your leisure. It's a 20 minute scheduled ferry ride out to the island and you can take any of the ferries back at anytime. I personally wish people would not bring children to this attraction. Yes, it's part of the park system, but I don't see how small children get anything out of being there and trying to navigate around the huge strollers people have these days really makes it hard to maneuver around.",5.0

Alcatraz Island,rundleview2017,Calgary,Canada,7,100% worth it.,Nov,2022,Very well organized and executed. Didn’t know what to expect but very glad we went and enjoyed the tour. We learned a ton about the mixed history of the island (Al Capone was incarcerated there!) and the role the American Indians played in assuring is a protected area and historic site today. The audio tour is pretty cool but with the crowds it’s hard to move at the pacing of the narrator - I listened in and out - it’s too bad the IOS App audio doesn’t allow for moving through or back through the content - it’s like listening to a tape you can’t rewind.,5.0

I learned a lot and it was strange to be walking on the same ground that so many prisoners walked for so many years. But - and I’m surprised I haven’t read any reviews that mention this - we went on a beautiful warm day (75 degrees), and the smell on the island was terrible at times and the flies were unbelievable. I have to think it’s caused by all the bird poop, which is sizable. The island should be cleaned up a little to make the experience a little better. Considering the amount of people travel through this site each day (and it must be a couple thousand), one would think they could afford to remove the collapsed buildings and keep the place a bit cleaner (power wash) which may reduce the smell and the flies. The boat crew was great. Their timeliness and friendly attitude was appreciated.",3.0

Alcatraz Island,MelissaClaire93,Cinnaminson,NJ83,4,Grab their audio tour vs. your phone,Oct,2021,Alcatraz has been on our lists for years so we were really excited to finally visit. The history and the setup is very fascinating. The rangers even gave a really interesting chat with some facts before the self guided tour began. There’s a really extensive gift shop with a lot of cool things. It’s a can’t miss in SF (especially for history lovers). My only tip is to grab one of the audio tours they offer instead of trying to do it from your phone. It was very “position sensitive” so you easily missed it if you held it in the wrong position…it would also turn off if you moved it slightly. Definitely didn’t work well for 2 people. I think it probably had a lot of interesting things but I couldn’t hear a lot because of the setup and the phone made it hard to follow as it kind of jumped ahead.

During a 2 week holiday in the States we hadn’t had to wear them anywhere else! As we hadn’t needed them, we left them in the hotel so we then had to purchase them for $2.25 each! The tour is well organised, you’re only allowed to queue for the boat when it’s your time, then they load and leave quite quickly. On the island there is a quick talk by one of the Rangers then you head up the hill to collect your Audio Tour (by this time a lot of people had removed their masks). I did the tour years ago and you were given headphones which were good because they blocked out all other noises, now you get a handset the size of a remote control, which is in a bag, then you hold it to your ear. The tour is still really good but I’m pretty sure it used to be much longer and because you can’t pause the Audio Tour is seems very rushed. When we’d given back the handset we then walked back to the places we wanted to revisit. It’s a good tour and Alcatraz is still an amazing place to visit.

The audio guide was a great way to learn about Alcatraz history and some of the anecdotes from previous guards and inmates. There were lots of other visitors so it did feel quite crowded at times. Although having to wear a mask was a little irritating, it made sense with the amount of people present. Variety of items to purchase in the gift shop and friendly staff around the island.

Welcomed to the queue by a woman YELLING at people standing outside about masks (then charging $2.25 USD to anyone needing one). Constant, consistent yelling. Welcome, indeed (not). Arrived at the island to find, well, not much. Two cells open, no 're-created' historical update, nothing really to even walk through. We love history and would have loved to see some real/re-made version of cells even. More space dedicated to a politically-charged 'exhibit' about how bad it is to incarcerate criminals. Not to mention the absolute lack of care on the landscaping throughout, the bird poop literally everywhere ('its fly season' (fly season is every day when birds are pooping all over).",1.0

Following the GPS directions is not easy for a 1st timer and I had to retrace my steps to access the tunnel that leads to the south view point. Take note that as far as I undertand the north and south lookouts are only accessible by crossing the bridge and then merging of the main bridge. I won't explain the directions because I personally was quite confused. Welcome to San Fransisco! We got a good view from the north view point, but at the south view point, fog rolled in and not much could be seen. I was most amazed at how thick and fast the fog can roll in. The ambince in the shrouded fog is a combination of AWE and EERIE. The south view point has a nice souvenir shop. Parking is equally challenging at both points. A must see when in San Fransisco.",5.0

No segundo dia que fui lá, praticamente não tinha neblina e consegui fazer vídeos e fotos tranquilamente. Em ambos os dias estacionei num estacionamento que fica em Presidio, para chegar nele, vindo pela Freeway US-101 North sair na saída 439 que fica próximo da Golde Gate, e depois disso sempre se manter a direita, vai pegar uma subida, passar por baixo da freeway, chegar num cruzamento com uma rua que é a rua que você provavelmente vai usar pra ir embora depois, e mais uns 300 metros para a frente tem uma entrada para um estacionamento gratuito que pelo menos quando fui tinha bastante vaga disponível, o problema naquele estacionamento é que há muitos casos de furtos relatados, é indicado deixar absolutamente nada dentro do carro a vista, ele chama Langdon Court Parking na Lincoln Boulevard, esse estacionamento dá pra ver pelo google Maps. E se colocar ele no Waze dá pra achar facilmente. Lá venta muito, e faz frio mesmo durante o verão e com sol de rachar, então indico levar ao menos um agasalho.",5.0

There are different models of the bridge to show how the supports work and how the bridge can move. There was tons of information and plenty of area to walk around to get tons of info and pictures. Not only that but they have made the area beautiful with many different kinds of flowers and plants.

I’d suggest downloading the Muni app where you can buy tickets and see the stops in real time. I returned my rental car when I arrived in San Francisco and used the Muni system for the weekend I visited. The app shows all the stops so you can plan out your day. We did the all day ticket instead of the $8 one and was glad we did. A family sitting in front of us were told their tickets expired, and he agued that he had bought them before standing in line. He wound up having to repurchase them, so I assume if you buy them at the booth they must have an expiration of a few hours. It’s also cheaper to buy a day ticket then 2 single rides. And you can use the trans and buses too, I used the tram to return from the Ferry Marketplace to the Wharf when my feet started to get tired. There are helpful employees at the cable car area too wearing orange jackets to help you with any questions. It seems like they are working hard to get tourists back and are there help them when needed. The only bad part was the wait to return back to union square was long, over an hour. I contemplated walking back to my hotel several times while waiting. Overall though, it was worth it. Our first ride on cable car and my kids loved standing on the sides.

Well, 3 blocks away from the hotel! Did we ever have to wait for the Cable Car? Yeah. Did it seem to make endless stops to pick up and drop off? Yeah. Were people sometimes complaining about this? Yeah. But, not us. Always courteous staff, and the $8.00 fare was worth it. So, do your research, see how close the Cable Car runs to your hotel in you're visiting, and enjoy. We sure did. And by the way ... as of April 2022, masks are no longer required.",5.0

Vale a pena comprar o passport para 1 dia pelo app MuniMobile, para mim custou 13 dólares. Isso porque se você pretende parar em Lombard Street por exemplo e depois continuar a usar o bonde terá que pagar outra passagem e cada passagem individual são 7 dólares e com o passport você consegue usar qualquer uma das opções de transporte público em San Francisco por um dia quantas vezes quiser. Esse bonde que passa pela Powell St vs Geary St é o Powell and Hyde St, o Cable car tem um total de 3 linhas, sendo duas muito parecidas que tem o mesmo ponto final, sendo elas essa primeira que citei e a Powell and Mason St, e tem uma terceira que te leva para o centro financeiro aonde ficam os prédios altos de San Francisco.

It was so frustrating that we usually ended up hiking up gigantic hills instead of waiting. When we did wait the time was sometimes as much as an hour.

It is literally switchback upon switchback down one of the steepest hills in town. What makes it crazier is that flowers line the street, and crowds of people are walking up and down while you are driving. At the bottom, the previous driver or passengers pop out of their car for some quick snapshots up the street, but because of the flowers obscuring the contours of the street it just looks like a field of flowers in the middle of a street. Suffice to say this is an experience you need to just DO. No video or photo will do it justice. Beware of the lines as well.

Golden Gate Park,PhilipL4,Cambridge,OH15,7,Nice park feels smaller than it is,Nov,2019,I can’t help compare this to Central Park. Similar size. This one feels smaller for some reason. Also feels more forced. There are a lot of roads running through it and around it and it is noisy. Many attractions cost money. Japanese Tea Garden is now $10 in the off season. Disappointed in the pagoda there. Seems they could have done a better job maintaining it instead of asking for donations to restore it. Rest of the park is a nice walk but I’m not sure it’s worth a special trip. Can stop in Haight-Ashbury when you are done.,4.0

Oracle Park,Jeffrey T,Indianapolis,IN2,4,"Wonderful ballpark with amazing views, but plan on waiting in line.",Sep,2019,I was in San Francisco for business and as a baseball fan I had to catch a game a Oracle Park. I arrived 2 hours early and was able to park in Lot A of third street for $40.00. Waling up to the stadium and checking out the statues near McCovey cove is pretty awesome. One thing to know going in is there is only 4 gates to enter the park. When 35k people are going into the game that is not many and the lines are long. They do have a special line for club seat ticket holders and if you have a Clear account you can get in quicker. Eat first!!! The lines get really long during the game and you could easily miss a inning or two waiting in line Compared to other parks the one thing that stood out to me is how tight the concourse is. If you are a baseball fan its a must check out but plan on arriving early and if you don't care who wins you might want to check out around the eight inning.,4.0

It's just too far with small children. Had I known, I would have called for a ride share. To get there we took a pedi ride. She said it was 25$ and then changed it to $40 as we were already en route. What a crock. Take a rideshare from the wharf, but the traffic is terrible starting about an hour before the game. If you want to take a electric streetcar, get on where it starts by the In and Out burger near the end of the wharf or it will be packed and unable to pick you up at any other stop along the way.

I was particularly impressed, however, by the number of ushers and their dedication to make the game a good experience for everyone. They were very attentive in ensuring that people didn't enter the seating area when the ball was in play, and they were effective in taking care of rude fans. Public transportation to the park is also excellent.",5.0

Oracle Park,TomKar,None,None,6,Perfect activity for baseball fans,Jul,2019,"Our trip to SF would not have been complete if we didn't get to visit Oracle Park. We knew we were going to have some free time on our last day in SF, so we luckily were able to book a tour on-line the night before. We (fortunately) arrived early (our Uber driver dropped us off at the corner of King and 2nd) and we were able to leisurely walk along King Street and read all the name plaques along the stadium wall but if you're pressed for time, have your driver drop you off near the Willie Mays Statue on the corner of King and 3rd. You'll need to pick up your tickets at the Giants Dugout Store further down 3rd St. The tour was fun and informative, especially for my 13 y.o. son. Granted, he LOVES baseball but I think this tour would be enjoyable for anyone who appreciates sports. We got to see the visitors clubhouse, the inside batting cages, dugout, skyboxes and more. We even got to venture out onto the field for some really great pictures. At the end of the tour, the tour guide brings you right back to the Giants Dugout store, which was ok because my Yankees fan son was ready to buy a Giants hat as a momento.",5.0

The area in the outfield is beautiful as it overlooks the Bay. It also has a lot of interactive areas and the BEST food in the entire ballpark. We got some food and was able to find a table overlooking the entire ballpark. It was amazing! We then found our seats and enjoyed a great game. The only downside was the $13.50 beers.

They must be conditioned to show up AFTER a game usually ends. They were looking for food scraps and it wasn't just a few birds ... it was 70-100 gulls who didn't care who they bombed with their excrement.

On our first evening in Fisherman’s we witnessed a car pull up alongside a stationary vehicle, a guy jump out, smashed the windows, stole some bags and sped off. Passersby didn’t bat an eyelid. The following day we witnessed multiple shop lifting. The staff were aware but didn’t act. Clearly this is par for the course in SF. The city has a massive homeless problem and many are drugged up statues or crazily shouting at people in the street.

We made reservations to a restaurant in the Wharf while in the airport waiting in line for our car rental. Although by the time we arrived to the wharf at 8:30pm, many of the shops I believe closed at 9pm. However great place to walk around, eat and watch the sea lions. Then next day on our way back from an Alcatraz tour we stopped in to eat at the Wipe Out for lunch, a great day to eat, people watch and shop. Most of the seals from the night before had since gone, so it probably depends on when you visit. My son who is 13 year old loved this place to just walk around and see the bay. Great views. We had a hotel within walking distance, so we did not have to worry about parking. The morning was very empty by lunch time many more people were out, but it never seemed crowded like NYC.

Fisherman's Wharf,Jim S,Boise,ID31,8,Ripped off at Fisherman's Wharf,Oct,2012,"I am a frequent visitor, part time resident of San Francisco and should have known better! I wanted to purchase a new and better set of Binoculars and thought, since there were a number of stores along and near Fisherman's Wharf, it would be a competitive and good place to purchase them. WRONG!! I should have known better! My wife and I went into one of the yellow signed camera/electronics stores, this one the On Line Camera Gallery, Inc., and asked to see their binocular selection. We were shown several and told they would give us a special deal on a set of Bushnell Perma Focus. They represented that the usual retail price for this set was $499 but they would sell them to us at the same price that the couple just next to us at the counter had paid, $350. We accepted the price and made the purchase. They gave us a receipt and asked that we also sign the receipt, in addition to the credit card charge. I then went back to our condo and looked up the binoculars on the internet. It turns out that this set of binoculars retails for $106 and was available, including shipping, from Bushnell for $64.98. I was angry!! I went back to the store and asked for a refund. This was refused with the clerk showing me that the receipt he had us sign said ""no refund"". I then asked what he was going to do to make me happy since he had lied to us as to the correct retail price and we had overpaid by so much. He said he was not authorized to make any changes. After a heated exchange, I finally got him to throw in an added pair of binoculars, the Olympus Trooper 7X35. I gave up and accepted this. It turns out the price the Olympus sell for on the internet is $51.99, including shipping. So, for our $350 we received $116 in value for merchandise. We were ripped off! So, I caution any visitors to San Francisco when shopping for cameras, electronics or other items from those yellow signed shops. It is sad that stores take advantage of tourists, leaving a bad taste for San Francisco, even as this city offers so much to visitors. If you just have to buy something at Fisherman's Wharf, know that you are at a disadvantage as you can't rely that these shops are truthful and that they are waiting for unsuspecting individuals. My advice is, go to the center of town to the large shops for this type of purchase. Unfortunately, my wife and I were naive.",1.0

Fisherman's Wharf,Christine C,Racine,WI5,2,Priority Parking is a scam!,Jul,2013,"Fisherman's Warf was a fun very touristy thing to do with tons of souvenir shops which was fine. You can't really visit SF with out saying you've been here or Pier 39. Lots of wonderful restaurants around here and you can find some very good deals on souvenirs if you are looking to take something home. Also we found that many are willing to wheel and deal with you if you ask. My big warning to you is DO NOT PARK AT A PLACE CALLED PRIORITY PARKING. THEY ARE A COMPLETE SCAM! We drove our car in the lot at noon on a Saturday down there. Their were cars ahead of us so we were farther back in the lot away from their small booth. It was valet style so we all got out the guy took our keys and said we pay when we get back. After a very long day of walking and walking and walking around SF, Pier 39, Lombard Street, Fisherman's Warf etc. we took a cab back to our car/parking lot. It was 9:45 on a Saturday night.... They were CLOSED! A note was on our car to get our keys from another lot in another part of town!!! We had to take a cab over to that lot, pay, get our keys then take another cab back to our car which all took about an hour and a half and cost us another $30.00 in addition to the $35.00 it was to park there! Insane! What kind of parking place closes at 6:00, yep that's right 6:00 is when they closed on a Saturday, in a tourist town and the attendants never told us to be back by 6:00 because we close. I think because they know we would have said REALLY?!? well we have to park somewhere else then! It does say their hours in very small print up by the tiny booth but not on the other side which is what you see driving in, that has the prices to park in the lot which everyone sees. I believe if they had it in large print on the sign they know that know one would park there because who would be ready to leave this tourist area at 6:00 on a Saturday nigh? Sheesh we were just starting dinner at that time. They are a scam, they have their hours in small print for a reason and it cost us $65.00 just to park here and a lot of extra screwing around. We had two little kids with us and were pushing it at 9:45 as for their bed time but then we ended up not leaving the parking lot until 11:30 after all the wasted time going back and fourth in an expensive taxi. Then when we complained to the manager of Priority Parking that the attendants should be telling people that they close at 6:00, he replied with ""it is not my problem"".

Fisherman's Wharf,Dean V,San Francisco,CA2,1,"No Locals, Just A Long Mall on the Water",May,2014,"I've lived in San Francisco since 1991 and will never for the life of me understand the unending attraction of Fisherman's Wharf. I'm not alone as no local I know ever spends time there except when visitors come to town and insist. It's a boring mall on the water. The only exception is to see the sea lions. Here's a real tip: walk west beyond Hyde Street toward the Aquatic Park. To me, everything west of Hyde Street along the Northern Waterfront is as good as SF gets & everything east of it is as bad as it gets. Hyde Street Pier with its historic ships is wonderful. My favorite accessible beach in SF is the Aquatic Park which has unbeatable views of the Golden Gate Bridge and as it is protected by a breakwater, the water is calmer and warmer than the bay in general. On hot days it's an invitation to wade or swim. Keep going over the hill to Fort Mason for more wonderful northern waterfront places like Fort Mason and Chrissy Field which are truly wonderful. I doubt this review will give anyone coming to San Francisco pause but honestly, you aren't experiencing the city at all at Fisherman's Wharf, just crap shacks full of t-shirts and restaurants where no one who lives here would ever think of dining.

The Exploratorium could have been an unusual interesting experience. However, the Exploratorium was full of large group of noisy children. Several times when we were looking at a board or an instruments the children simply jumped in and took over and I had to tell them that we were actually looking or using the instrument. I have never in the world experienced anything like that. It was like as if they had not been brought up at all - had learned nothing about how to behave.. Even children not in groups but right next to their parents behaved like this .. and the parents didn't say anything. In the beginning we were laughing at this rude kind of behaviour, because it was so unexpected, but in the end we left the museum because it was so annoying. Also they were running around yelling. The museum is not to blame for the behaviour of the visitors, but they could consider to make some areas for people older than 12 years old or some areas suitable for smaller kids, so that everyone could have a nice experience. Also I truly doubt that these kids understand anything of what the museum is trying to teach them...",1.0

Exploratorium,ExploSF,None,None,"Hello, We are sorry to hear that you were so disappointed in your experience at the museum's new location. We certainly do not agree with or support your unnecessary comments regarding the intellect of our visitors. So that you have all of the facts, and for others who will read this review, we offer this… For more than 50 years, the Exploratorium has offered a place for the curious to learn more about the world around them. We encourage visitors of all ages and staff to ask questions and question answers—and millions of people from around the world have done so. We have inspired countless students, scientists, doctors, artists, makers, innovators, and educators with our work. While the Palace of Fine Arts (PFA) will always be a part of who we are as an iconic SF organization, the space was also much smaller and did not give the museum ample room to grow both our reach and experience. Nearly all of the popular experiences and exhibits from the PFA were moved to the new location at Pier 15, and hundreds more exhibits were also added in a much brighter, more open modern space. There is a reason that the museum has been rated the #1 Museum in SF consistently for the last 3+ years here on TripAdvisor.","Written June 9, 2020",This,response,Ties10,1.0

I mean we grew up near the Science and Industry museum in Chicago and I've been to the Franklin Institute in Philly like way too many times. Our SF relatives suggested this place, and we initially said, no, not interested. But then when we were on a tour to Muir Woods, our guide looked at us like we had 3 heads when we said we weren't interested in going to a science museum. He's like oh, you HAVE to go there, (and we had 3 kids with us ages 7, 10, and 14). We were more into seeing the redwoods and Alcatraz and SF history, but we reconsidered squeezing this in. SO GLAD we did!!! Our 80 year old relative enjoyed it as much as we and our kids did. This is basically more of a hands on experiment museum. Truly fascinating in so many areas of science. We spent about 2+ hours here but we considered going back a day later because we only saw a little more than half. We just didn't have time to go back. It's really really cool, and our middle schooler got LOTS of science project ideas that we had never even thought of (and my husband and I have doctorates in the science fields), so yeah, it's totally fun even for the professionals!

Exploratorium,LuanaMH,Bernville,PA1,5,Not worth it,Apr,2014,"On a recent trip to San Francisco, we decided to go to the Exploratorium - the descriptions we read made it sound great. Unfortunately it wasn't. It cost $88 for four of us and that didn't even cover the tactile dome. It was essentially an indoor playground where parents let their little kids run around from one station to another unattended. It was a free-for-all. There was no natural flow through the very large ""warehouse"". You had to wait for every station and then just when it seemed clear that you were next, some small child would run in and jump in front of you. When my 80 yr.-old mother, who has problems walking, saw the situation, she went and sat on a bench and never even got to any of the exhibits. My 57 yr.-old husband was frustrated and bored with the whole thing, cruised through in an hour and then went outside and sat in a chair. Only my 17 yr.-old son and myself tried to fight through. IMPORTANT - THIS IS NOT A PLACE FOR YOUNG CHILDREN. Each station has a set of instructions that you need to read to understand what to do there and then a written explanation of the science that is occurring. Young children won't understand/appreciate this and will get antsy, frustrated or disinterested very quickly. I saw this happening all day long. Having them there ruins it for those that are truly interested. I would not bring any child under the age of 7 or 8. Also, there are only two food options there - an expensive sit-down restaurant (which is not open the entire afternoon) and a very expensive café with very limited food selection. If you want to visit a good science museum, check out the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia.",2.0

Not even the exploratorium’s fault, unless they at some point start turning people away because #firecode. It just made me hate humanity. Lots of parents were using this as a play place where they were drinking coffee on their phones while their kids ran amok. The parents that were involved were almost worse, since they allowed their little snowflakes to just use the exhibit for as long as they wanted never acknowledging the other kids waiting. My son ended up so disappointed the whole time because he would see something cool and never get a chance to use it.

There are a lot of exhibits here - give yourself enough time to explore for at least two hours. Different rooms focus on different themes, like light and color or motion. There are multiple experiments in each room, but usually only one person at a time can do them and there's only one of each. I imagine on a busy day with a lot of families present, it might be difficult to actually get your hands on one. We attended the After Dark event on a Thursday night, which is adults only. This really allowed us to explore and experiment, but again, the place is large and we didn't have time to do everything. I would visit again. I would definitely bring my kids here or come solo, and I loved the After Dark idea. Wish more museums held events like it.",5.0

My husband, myself, and our 3.5 year old daughter arrived right as their doors were opening at 10am, and we had the place mostly to ourselves. As you transitioned from one interactive station to the next, you may see one or two other parents with their children exploring, but you felt engaged, and unrushed, and free to explore! Come noon though, and the place had become a madhouse. We did visit the Sunday before superbowl, so I don't know if that is indicative of the crowd, or if that is a typical Sunday afternoon, but by 12, you could really not go anywhere without running into (IMO) way too many kids. When it started to become more of a hassle (kids cutting in line, with no parents disciplining) we decided to take off.

On Thursday evenings, however, the over 650 interactive exhibits are turned over exclusively to adults (over 18 years old) in what is billed as Exploratorium ""After Dark"". Uninhibited by the tendency to let the children go first, adults, often in couples or groups of friends, are encouraged to let their inner scientist loose. The opportunity to purchase alcohol during the evening probably assists with the warm, somewhat romantic ambience that is created. In addition to all of the daytime exhibits, each Thursday evening provides adult specific programming including guest speakers, music, film and specific themed discussions. It would make for a fantastic first date setting since conversation and laughter flow easily as individuals are puzzled by the wonders of scientific principles. Well done, Exploratorium.",5.0

Twin Peaks,dan_leifker,Laughlin,NV1,1,Best way to walk to Twin Peaks,Oct,2013,"I walk to the top of Twin Peaks for exercise a lot and I know all the paths and routes. It's possible to walk to the top on Twin Peaks Blvd, the same route that cars take, but there is no sidewalk and the road narrows at a few points and can be dangerous if you're not constantly watching out for cars coming around the curves. A much more pleasant route is to take 24th St from Noe Valley west until it dead-ends at stairs that go under Market St. Right on Corbett Ave and then left on Hopkins, up the hill, and left on Burnett. A few steps farther you will see a staircase that is labeled ""Vista Ln"" on Google maps. Take the stairs all the way up to Crestline, and look for the hiking sign that marks the trail to Twin Peaks. You can go all the way to the top of either peak or to the observation area a little lower. On windy days it's quite horrible (like standing on the wing of an airplane in flight) but sunny days with no wind you will honestly feel like a bird flying over San Francisco. Total trip from the center of Noe Valley to the top and back: about 1 hour, not including gazing time at the summit or rest breaks. Wear a hat if the sun is shining and you sunburn easily!",5.0

There are Grecian women looking over the edge ""into"" the theater, greek urns on the ledges, latticework in the rotunda, stunning columns in a russet red color, shell and floral stonework at the top of the pillars; everywhere you look there is something more to see.

Palace of Fine Arts Theatre,geotech522,5,59,4,Spectacular architecture and beautiful lagoon,Jan,2020,"The Palace of Fine Arts was one of ten palaces that comprised the grounds of the 1915 Panama-Pacific Exhibition. The Palace of Fine Arts was designed by Architect Bernard Maybeck, who took his inspiration from Roman and Ancient Greek architecture in designing what was essentially a fictional ruin. Although designed only to last for the temporary period of the exhibition, the Palace of Fine Arts continued to be used for San Franciscans. However, because the colonnade and rotunda were not built of durable materials, and were framed in wood and then covered with staff, a mixture of plaster and burlap-type fiber, the structure became a crumbling ruin. In 1964, the Palace was demolished and was completely rebuilt with modern durable materials. It remains a startling architectural wonder to behold. The adjacent lagoon adds to the mystique of the Palace giving some wonderful reflections at day or night.",5.0

Palace of Fine Arts Theatre,doctorbove,Sacramento,CA10,5,Great location with beautiful grounds!,Jul,2019,"We were fortunate enough to have a chance to see Aaron Mahnke and Chad Lawson (piano) perform work from his Lore podcast last night at the Palace of Fine Arts Theatre. Just walking up to the venue, from any direction, will leave you in awe. The Beaux-Arts architecture brings you back to the period that encapsulated the 1915 Panama-Pacific Exposition era, and the surrounding gardens soothe the soul. In 1970, what used to be the Exhibit Hall became what is now the theatre. Upon entering the building, you will find a main room/foyer that serves as a home for the small snack/drink and reception area, as well as the restroom facilities. Inside the theatre itself, the seating is divided by even and odd numbers; even being on the right hand side while odd numbers reside on the left. Being in the front row, the only thing we did not account for were the smaller, monitor-type speakers, mounted to the front top-side of the stage. Note: This may pose a problem for shorter individuals attending a seated show. Throughout the event that we saw last night, the guest speaker, Aaron Mahnke, stood in the middle to front area of the stage for the duration of the presentation so the speakers did not cause an obstruction of view. Although the inside of the venue is on the larger side (966 seats), it still seems rather intimate. The seats are comfortably spaced, and recline slightly, so it was a perfect environment to listen to some spooky stories from an excellent narrator/author! Plus, the piano accompaniment provided by Chad Lawson was second to none! Thank you again to both Aaron and Chad for an entertaining break from the norm. Needless to say, we will definitely keep an eye out for more reasons to come back into San Francisco for future visits to this Bay Area gem!",5.0

Ferry Building Marketplace,Brandon K,None,None,"Flagstaff, AZ1,692","This is a great place, depending on what you want from it.",Aug,2022,"This is a food market and small store experience. There are some restaurants as well, but the main focus is cook at home or take away food, like pastas, candy, pastries, etc. There are wine tasting and hummus tasting stalls. We walked the whole area before deciding which stalls to come back to. If you are in the mindset of going through little artisan stalls and spots, this place is for you and you will give it even more than 4 stars. If you are looking for touristy take home gifts, this might not be for you (unless gourmet food is your choice for gifts). I will say that this is a stop you need to see if it is your first time to San Francisco, but you might choose other places on a return trip, unless there is something at the Ferry building you are hooked on and want more of in the future.",4.0

Ferry Building Marketplace,Belson616,San Francisco,CA1,4,ll.Sensory Experience,Jun,2019,"I can remember taking the car ferries from Oakland to San Francisco in the late '40s. Always a family outing. The wooden ferries smelled of oil, gas, auto emissions, and wonderful foggy salt air. The the Ferry Building was just that. A place for the ferries to land. Now, the same, but a wonderful food gathering with so many wonderful smells. Next time I may go blindfolded and speak out as to what I can sense. ""Food Court"" is not a good description. It is a gathering place of artisans who skillfully present a single product (coffee, cheese, flowers, chocolates) or small companies laying out, with skill, a variety of things (cookware, books) and family run restaurants. Each places is so well done that one is pulled in to explore, with interest, all that can be seen. It might be cheating, but one might go there and only feast on the taste samples that are offered. To exit East is the Bay with ferries coming and going all of the time. Western Gulls feeding at the rear of each ferry as the turbulence from the props desiccates fish and sending up morsels to be eaten by the gulls. Flying overhead a squadron of Brown Pelicans gracefully plunging into the water for fish. A treat that day was a Heermann's Gull who are noted for following Pelicans and foraging after the fish that spill out of the pelican's bill. Appetite enough I stopped at the Hogg Island Restaurant. Famous for their Tomales Bay (California) oysters. At my age I must grasp at any myth so I ordered six good oysters and a fruit salad. All one would need to eat.

You can get all sorts of drinks such as cream soda, milk by itself, yogurt, etc. (the milk's very fresh and creamy) and top quality cheese. Lunch is definitely the theme of the entire marketplace. Everywhere you look is another option to chow, and wherever you end up you won't be disappointed. Very popular with business suits who I assume work in the sky-rises across the street.

California Academy of Sciences,California Academy of Sciences,None,None,"Hi there! Thanks for visiting, and we love your concern for Claude. Claude's blind (a condition related to his albinism), and his enclosure was designed specifically for him based on that and on the general needs of a large, ambush predator of his species. He knows his space well, interacts daily with the animals he shares it with (including our devoted, human biologists), & when not cruising, eating, or interacting likes to conserve energy and regulate body temp by relaxing on his heated rock. Claude wouldn't survive in the wild, so we're honored to be his home—and we care deeply about being the best one possible. Thanks!","Written February 13, 2020",This,response,Traveleator,5.0

We are always very interested in what our visitors have to say and hope to learn from them. We did want to clear up one point in this review. The reason the aquarium tanks are made from acrylic is for seismic safety. In the event of an earthquake, water moving in the tanks creates a lot of pressure, and acrylic will not shatter.

California Academy of Sciences,kidzrn1,Los Angeles,CA9,3,Waste of Money!,Apr,2013,"This place doesn't know what it wants to be when it grows up. Is it an aquarium? is it science museum? a natural history museum? really it doesn't matter because it sucked which is sad because i was so excited when i planned to go. Took my hubby, my 9yr old and 11 yr old. First off the cost of tickets is a over priced for what's inside. The place looks big from the outside but there's really not much to do inside. There is the rainforest ball thing as you go in...which Feels like being trapped in a sweaty armpit that you can't escape. literally once you go inside you are stuck walking through the entire boring thing while dripping in humidity. Then it finally spits you out underneath the rainforest and into the aquariums below. This area is the only good part of the entire museum but not enough to redeem it. Then the had an earthquake exhibit that was terrible, a few stuffed animal dioramas, and There is a planetarium...zzzzzzzz! The last straw for me was the food. After walking the entire boring museum I was starving and dying of thirst! The cafeteria they have only sells organic, granola, tree hugger food...which translates into "" tastes like leaves and grass"" Seriously, I couldn't even get a coke or sprite...not even a bag of normal chips or crackers. With kids this is very bad...very very bad! After over paying for the tree hugger organic fake cokes, organic juice, and tasteless organic food... we tried to eat it. (Insert sounds of my children complaining and gagging here) It was so nasty we threw it all out in the end. I will not be back to San Francisco...Over all it is not a kid friendly city compared to L.A. The museums in Los Angeles Exposition park are a thousand times better than this one. The California science center in L.A. is FREE to visit and is fabulous. Then you have the Natural history museum and the space shuttle next door.

When they first opened the new museum, I wrote to lodge my complaints and was ignored. It isn't that I mind spending money but I want value for my money and I want people to have access to museums even if they aren't well off. Lower prices and offer wonderful museum quality things to purchase in the shops to make the profit necessary. I bought a beautiful ammonite at the old museum. A huge Russian ammonite with pyrite. People who can will spend money. For those who can't, keep the museum accessible.",1.0

California Academy of Sciences,Ana V,Eugene,OR53,6,Overpriced and felt like a giant daycare,Mar,2014,"This museum was an enormous disappointment. We paid a very hefty price per person to get inside and then we found that many exhibits are just pictures and the written description of the picture. The place was full to the brim with hundreds of wild school children on field trips. The quantity was such, that the museum should have been closed and dedicated exclusively to the school children for the day. The yelling was so much, my daughter left and waited for us outside after only 30 minutes. The lines to get into the earthquake simulator was so long we gave up trying to get inside. The so called aquarium, barely qualifies as an aquarium, The only thing worth going to is the show in the Planetarium, ""Dark Matter."" That was a very good show, but not worth paying $35.00 per person. I would not pay to go in this museum. My son is 12 and he said it was boring. I asked what age group he thought it was appropriate for and he said ages 5 to 8. So if you have children 5 to 8, and you really need to entertain them, then maybe this is the place.

You can pay $12 for the general admission or pay $59 for the VIP tour. We chose the VIP tour and were so glad we made this decision. The VIP tour allows you to enter the museum through the membership entrance, so no staying in line here. Then they take you to an extra area were they offer you drinks and appetizers, which are included in the VIP price. You have 30 minutes to mingle, we were around 30 people, and then the behind the tour started. They guide you through the museum, explaining things about the history and take you behind the scenes. We liked meeting some of the Scientists who are working on different projects and we were able to ask questions. The tour takes one hour and then they take you to the rain forest. Now remember that if you enter on the normal ticket you enter the museum and stay in line to enter most exhibits like the rain forest or the planetarium. As VIP you dont. They took us to the rainforest and we just entered through a different door. Now you have time until 8:30 pm to explore the museum on your own. At 8:30 pm you have pre-booked seats at the Planetarium. By the time we reached it there was a huge line, but no worries you go again to a extra entrance and not only do they let you in from there you get to enter the Planetarium separate and can chose the best seats! We watched the Earthquake show and it was amazing. All in all we had a great evening and if you never visited the museum before I would highly encourage to spend a bit more, but get lots of information and service for it.",5.0

The rainforest is very neat and we read the exhibits but I feel they could have done so much more with explaining about the rainforests. They mostly had aquariums with individual animals and info on them and beautiful butterflies. The planetarium theatre is beautiful but the movie (it seemed more like an IMAX movie than a planetarium show) was the most boring one I have ever seen. Yes, I know it won an award - I found myself marveling at the technology used to create it - but what did I really learn?

The interactive screens next to most exhibits were really neat as you can get a lot more information than a standard placard. The rain forest was a lot of fun and the walkway gives you access to the elevated areas. And the planetarium show was spectacular. Oh, and the living roof is a really cool place to take photos.

Not very cheap (35 $ for adult) but I think it's worth every penny. Arrive early as there is a lot to see. And early in the day there are no lines. First I visited the Rain Forest which is an area that simulates a rainforest with several birds, plants, small animals and numerous butterflies. For those who don't know a rainforest, it's a great opportunity. Humidity and heat are identical. Then I went down to the aquarium and spent almost 3 hours there. The variety of plants, fish, crustaceans they have around is incredibly amazing. This part alone would be worth the visit. There is an outdoor aquarium also with stingrays and other fishs and a roof top. The planetarium is more a 180 degree cinema than exactly a planetarium, but the film is well produced and well explained. For little kids, it may be a little difficult. Sessions happen every 2 hours, so book your ticket (included at the entrance, but you have to book it) as soon as you arrive. The food in the restaurant is quite varied, with healthy options with San Francisco prices, around 10-20 $ with bevarages. If you are thinking to arrive after 2 p.m., is better to come back in another day. For the price e the amount of things to see, is a attraction for the whole day and the Academy closes 5 pm.",5.0

It boasts to be the worlds only Aquarium, Planetarium, SCIENCES & Education facility. It is a lot of fun and I’m pleased to say - pretty educational too. It’s $40 per adult which is pretty steep - but as we are on vacation so we thought why not. They do VIP nights and get x2 cocktails and the roof terrace which we would have booked in advance if we had known. We went between 13:30 - 16:00 - as you might expect - there was a lot of kids from summer camps and loads of families. The white Crocodile can be viewed from above and from below the water which is neat. A popular part of the experience. We lost our sun glasses in the aquarium rest room and they were not handed in to list property which was a shame. You can leave your details and they will email you if they are handed in. The planetarium was fun. My partner had never been in one. Greg was our host - along with the voice of Tom hanks who recorded the film we watched in the year 2000. It needs updating - but I imagine Tom has been busy on the Toy Story voice overs and watching English Soccer (!). Greg does talk about 2/3 of the way through with updates which was good. He seemed pretty knowledgeable and offered to answer questions at the end of the x30 min presentation. Plenty of gift shops. If you donate $2000 individually to the institute you have access to a special lounge with free drinks high above the foyer - the room was open so we had a little rest in there. The roof garden is nice - but today was windy and cold with not much info so we came back down. Kids around us said it was like the BBC’s teletubbies ! The aquarium show in the basement had a live feed to the diver in the tank so you could here the conversations - been to many aquariums but this is the 1st time I’ve known this to happen. It worked well. The fish on display were varied. Clean tank. There is a rain forest with giant fish and butterflies. I work in a zoo with a real bat cave and the fruit bats fly around freely. Here there are projections of bats - but the effect was good. You spiral up like being in a tropical Guggenheim museum surrounded by butterflies. When at the top you get the lift down and it goes ‘into’ the tank which is also pretty neat and unusual. We think the centre is a bit overpriced. $30 max for a x2/3 hour experience seems a bit more reasonable. The planetarium is included in the admission but you have to queue and get tickets on a first come - first served basis. There was a virtual reality experience for an extra $12 per person.",5.0

Instead the exhibits were narrowly focused on a rain forest and swamp exhibit - which is what we live in, in New Orleans. And our own Aquarium of the Americas in New Orleans is vastly superior to this one. Instead of space and planet information, the planetarium was used for a film about coral reefs, advising the audience to not eat meat OR sea food, but to become vegetarians in order to save the coral reefs. The volunteer in the ""Africa"" anthropological exhibit gave a nice talk about ""Lucy"" but ended it with a warning that we too will be extinct by 2050 if we dont stop using plastic straws.

The Rainforest is absolutely unique and the aquarium is a total knockout, especially walking through the glass tunnel. The folks who work here are polite and helpful. Most seem genuinely interested in providing quality. For folks who have trouble getting around, they do loan wheelchairs here and there are plenty of elevator and ramps. My wife, who was hobbled by a recent foot operation, was grateful for that. We did find handicap parking in the lower garage, but it was still a long walk up some outside steps to get into the Academy. We did get online and tried to follow the directions to use the 9th street entrance for better access, but the roads in the park are labyrinth, so we never did find ideal handicapped parking.

You have to have your proof of purchase printed - not just on your phone. So plan ahead. Then you wait in the ticket line. Then wait in line again in the entry line. Put someone in both lines so you can jump in the second line after the first. Parking is free in the park for 4 hours if you park along the road. Beware of this though. We parked and walked in to the museum and then left for lunch and moved our car and then returned and parked again and finished our day. I figured that would work but we got a ticket anyway. Maybe take a picture of your car in the first spot and in the second spot so you can have proof you moved it. Or possibly park on a different road. We had never had a problem doing this before but we had out of state plates and a roof carrier on our car so i'm sure we stood out! $71 ticket. Should have paid to park in their parking garage. The museum is great. If you can only visit one place... go here, This includes an aquarium, rocks, frogs, butterflies, and they even had a bunch of Polynesian dancers do a performance in the center area. - We watched from the 2nd floor and our view was great. The entry includes a ticket to the imax theater but get your tickets when you first arrive so you will get in. It made my daughter sick so she just slept through it. If nothing else it gives you a comfortable seat for a nap! You can take food in as long as you only eat in the food area. Pack a picnic and save the long lines in the cafeteria and the money.

California Academy of Sciences,Laura W,Elgin,IL4,0,Unique Museum Experience,Jun,2013,"As a regular visitor to science museums around the country and one who has been particularly spoiled by the quality of museums in my home city of Chicago, I was interested to learn whether the California Academy of Science would live up to my expectations. Traveling with my 18-year-old daughter as well as my niece and her two preschool-age girls meant that we were looking for a museum that would entertain and educate a wide span of age levels. That tall order was more than met by the CAoS. Exhibits here, while not as extensive as the those in the Field Museum (Chicago), did cover a variety of science topics, including animal life, human evolution, earth science, planetary science and ecosystems. Many exhibits are hands-on (always a hit with small children) and the explanatory notations are easy to read, yet informative. The exhibits our group enjoyed the most - and which I have not seen before - were the penguin feeding and the walk-through rain forest. The rain forest was exceptional in that you walk upward through a changing canopy amid hundreds of butterflies. Everyone of us was delighted to see these beautifully delicate creatures fearlessly land on our hands and shoulders. This experience alone was worth the price of admission (which for my daughter and I was included in our San Francisco City Pass). The museum's location in Golden Gate Park is a beautiful setting for a stroll before or after visiting the exhibits, and parking is conveniently adjacent the museum and not unreasonably priced (for those accustomed to big city parking rates.)",5.0

We are from Chicago, and Chicago museums blow this one out of the water for far less money. Even the Milwaukee Public Museum is far superior. The rain forest exhibit was closed. Since that was about 1/3 of the museum, maybe the price should have been reduced. The earthquake exhibit was okay, but I think they could have done alot more with it. The animal piece was boring - I'd rather go to the zoo. The planetarium was okay. We saw the earthquake movie, and it was pretty lame. The aquarium was by far the nicest part. I did like it better than Chicago's Shedd. However, the way they displayed info about the tanks was silly. It was an electronic screen that showed one fish/animal at a time. Each page displayed for about 1 minute. I wasn't interested in staring at a tank for 5 minutes to see what each fish was. Either change the screens so visitors can scroll through them or go old school and use static signs. Overall, I would not recommend this to anyone.

Sadly felt that it was all style over substance and claims to contain more than it does. The rainforest dome is nice but will take you half an hour max to view, the roof garden is a very small area that you can stand in and look at how they have turfed the roof to save water - you could view this from across the pathway on the 9th floor of the De Young museum which is an amazing huge floor to ceiling glass walled space with magnificent views across San Francisco and it's free. The aquarium is nice but there are many aquariums in California - I hear Monterey is the one to go to if you can. The planetarium was a huge disappointment, it was really used as an Imax cinema to show you a film about trees and dna particles inside things - very little planetary solar images. Penguins - well there are about 10 of them behind a glass wall. It was nice enough but if you come from a big city like London and are used to Science museums/Natural history museums - all with modern interactive gadgets then you may well be disappointed. The building is large but space is wasted here, there was a large central glass room with chairs in that appeared to be where a lecture might be given but was not utilised for anything all day except by a few people eating picnics.

If you are visiting from out of town, I would not put this on a 2 day itinerary. I might put it on a 3 day if it was raining and the kids were into it.

California Academy of Sciences,California Academy of Sciences,None,None,"Hi Kayohh7, thanks so much for visiting, and for your feedback! Wanted to respond to it more specifically in case helpful for future visits, so please know that our capacity is always limited to 25%, but we're absolutely aware that people do tend to bunch up in some of our aquarium areas, so we've taken steps to address this. Among the ways we're responding: Staffing up to improve guest flow in all areas of the museum (especially in the aquarium) and to better encourage distancing and mask-wearing; installing even more floor markers for spacing and distancing reminders; continuing to identify places we can implement more one-way traffic; and keeping attendance capped at 25%. We're also actively escorting out anyone not wearing a mask. And with limited space inside closed exhibits like the Rainforest it's definitely a challenging time right now, but we're working hard to keep access as open as we can while still keeping everyone safe, hence the reservation system. Some helpful tips: You can make Rainforest reservations the moment you walk in (on your phone or with a guest-experience person); earlier ticket times can always help; and if it makes sense for you, picking up a membership means you can make exhibit reservations online in advance too. Re. your rescheduling issue, dynamic pricing does mean ticket prices can be a bit different at specifics days/times, but feel free to give us a call at 415-379-8000 if you have any other questions or concerns—we're happy to help, and so glad to hear you're headed back!

I had called to ask this question, and aside from it taking about 5 different ways to try to get an answer, the attendant finally told me that if you purchase the tickets on line and can't make that day, ""We may give you a courtesy to reschedule and maybe that will be good for a week, maybe a month but after that we won't reschedule and we never refund.""",3.0

From there you can go visit the park and/or take a walk to Cliff House for a over view of Ocean Beach and Seals Island. Then, walk to Sutro Bath, which used to be a beach side swimming complex. At the side of Sutro Bath,there is a tunnel and in it there is a blow hole. Thereafter, you can walk up to Point Lobos, a platform with a great ocean view. From the platform, you can walk up the steps to Lands End Trail. Except for the initial up steps, it is a relatively easy trail. It will loop back back to the visitor centre (about 5.4 km).

Also from the Cliff House (well known San Francisco restaurant) overlooking Seal Rock and Ocean Beach you can hike the trails of Lands End and visit the coffee shop and gift center there run by the National Parks. From there if you proceed up the hill further , you will come to a traffic light opposite Seal Rock Inn. if you turn left there and travel all the way up the hill to the parking area you will see the WW2 memorial dedicated to the USS San Francisco which was heavily damaged by Japanese shells which killed Admiral Callaghan while he was present on the bridge of that ship. A stark reminder of the horrors of war are the ships bridge wings full of shell holes and the mast from that battle which stand at the western end of that parking lot with the names of all the Marines and Sailors who lost their lives on that ship. You will see excellent viewing there of the entrance to San Francisco with a view of Golden Gate bridge to the East and Northern Headlands of Marin County.

Lands End,mgmarks,Washington DC,DC8,7,Great hike,Nov,2017,"Don't pay for a tour of this. The 38R bus ends up right at the National Park Building. There are restrooms available here. The hike is not too difficult, but stunningly beautiful. It is well marked and well maintained. It is a hard pack surface with lots of use. So, as I said, you don't need a guided tour. If you walk all the way to the Golden Gate Bridge it is 4 1/2 miles. Once you get to China Beach, which is not so well marked, the walk moves from woods to mostly city streets and is a bit difficult to follow unless you use your phone navigation. Using the phone it's easy. From Lands End Park Station it is about 1 mile to Mile Rock Beach, which is well marked. The walk down and particularly back up is a bit strenuous; but it is amazing and well worth the effort. When you get almost to the bottom there is a trail to the right going up a hill. At the top of the trail is the Labyrinth, which is interesting and the views from up there are great. Mile Rock beach is great for just enjoying the ocean and the views and climbing around on the rocks by the water. You could have a great relatively easy hike by just doing a round trip from the Park HQ to Mile Rock Beach and back and skip going all the way to Golden Gate Bridge. If you do decide to go all the way to Golden Gate Bridge there is a bus stop and you can take the Golden Gate bus back into most areas of town. Of course UBER is everywhere also. Bus Drivers will tell you if they go where you want to and if not what bus to take. This is one of those must do hikes in the area. Enjoy.",5.0

My recommendation if you're downtown: take the #5 (Fulton) trolley and get off at La Playa St & Cabrillo St. There's a Safeway, where you can purchase stuff for a picnic. Walk south across Fulton St. to get to Golden Gate Park, where you can visit the Dutch Windmill and the Tulip Garden, and then down on John F. Kennedy Drive and across the Great Highway to Ocean Beach. Walk north to the end, where you can the Cliff House and Camera Obscura. Further North you’ll see the Sutro’s Baths, and then East, along Point Lobos Ave., you’ll find the entrance to your right to Sutro’s Heights Park, right before 48th Ave. When you exit Sutro Heights follow the Lands End trail until the end (northern trails have the best views of the Golden Gate Bridge) and then take El Camino Del Mar back to the Legion.

Includes some optional steep steps down to the Labyrinth (great view of bridge from here) at one point, and some mandatory steep steps up if you want to get all the way to Eagle Point (definitely worth it for the view along Baker Beach to the bridge), but there are many great views across the Golden Gate and of the bridge along the way if you don’t make it to the end.",4.0

One hundred yards in the tunnel you will find a side outlet to the ocean where the waves push in. When a good wave come it compressed the air in the tunnel and your ears too. The view of the bay at the end of the tunnel is worth the trip. Back at the top of the baths there are many trials from which there are views, wildlife, birds, and trees.",5.0

Makes one wonder how it was like when there was still a building there. We continued our adventure on the trails, and there were several spots that you can take pictures of, with the Golden Gate Bridge in the background. There are several steps that might be difficult for certain people, however, you can still catch a beautiful view, even if it is not easy for you to hike.

Stop along the way and savor the fresh air, ocean, rocks and tranquility. Imagine being a hopeful 1849 gold prospector travelling across the world sailing through the gate or a battle fatigued World War II soldier sailing home under the Golden Gate Bridge. Contemplate the skill it took to maneuver vessels on those rough waters into the bay. It's best to walk on a sunny day for at times it can be very foggy, windy and cold (unless you love that!). The fog can roll in unexpectedly from nowhere so be prepared by wearing layers and sunscreen. You are walking near cliffs high above the ocean. It's not entirely flat --- there are some steep parts and a challenging staircase if you walk west to east. Some walkways are narrow, some wide.

I would not recommend the entire trail if you are unstable on your feet, but you can walk far enough to at least see the Golden Gate bridge You have the option of going down some very, very long steep steps to the beach, which it just beautiful one you get there. I will say the climb down and up was a killer. My knees were killing me and I got winded. I am 50 and in average physical condition.

We quickly noticed that off the normal trail, down below on the cliffs above the Pacific Ocean, there were smaller walking trails. We made our way down the cliffs to these trails and it was soooo much better than being on the normal trail above. I highly suggest you take these cliff-side trails. Much better views since you are not among the trees and you can get right out on the edge of the cliffs. These trails make there way back towards the bay and you can see the GG Bridge.

Most of the trail is dirt, and there are some ups & downs, as well as rocky areas. There is an area with quite a stair climb (100s of stairs). Not too far into the trail, there is a set of stairs to the left. That will take you down to a gorgeous sandy beach area. We spent some time down there exploring and were able to see quite a bit of sea life. There are about 200+ stairs going down to the beach. We did bring our BOB jogging stroller on this trail, and were able to use it for most of the hike, the stairs being the only exception. We did leave the stroller tucked behind a tree at the stair area going down to the beach to save us from carrying it down this set of stairs. The other stairs we carried the stroller up and down. The views along this trail are gorgeous. Without fog, you will get a brilliant view of the Golden Gate. At the beginning of the trail, you will also see the Sutro baths, which are neat to see.

Very beautiful location to walk around and explore. The staff was friendly and the exhibits where well developed and lots to read and see. The museum is a two-story building with an elevator. You need about two hours if you are really reading and looking at the artifacts. The museum café was closed at the time we went. It really made us miss Disneyland and gave us a more insight to Walt Disney the man. We will be coming back again soon.",5.0

It looks really small on the outside, but its huge. In the lobby there is all of Walt's awards, its pretty amazing to look at all of them. You can spend an hour just in the lobby. Then you go through the downstairs rooms, which are about his childhood. There is a lot of reading to do, but there are videos for kids too. Then you take an elevator upstairs to the next rooms which there are several (maybe 8?). There is tons of interactive things to do and more reading. There are also benches so if you get tired you can sit for a little while. Then you think the museum is all done and you're walking through a tunnel-like thing which is all glass and you have a beautiful view of the golden gate bridge..... then suddenly you step into this amazing room with a ramp winding all throughout 2 stories of this huge room. You can't even discribe it, its amazing. Everything is glowing and its truly Disney. Walt Disney's train is on display and a small replica of Disneyland is too. There are some more short videos and stuff and then you are done. The gift shop is really nice, if you collect old Disney things, go in there.

It's a very nice museum about Walt Disney and as far as museums go very well done. The beginning of the museum had many family stories about Walt's family and it was interesting to see the business ideas of Walt Disney develop out of company needs. It would be nice to have family albums about myself when my life pasts in such a museum, though it is certainly about Walt Disney and not the Disney company. This museum is pleasant but feels a bit like visiting a memorial of Walt Disney rather than being entertained with ""Disney"".

We learned several new things and spent a little less than 2 hours exploring. I am glad we went since I am not sure the next time we will be anywhere near there. The gift shop was small, and I did not find any must haves. I was hoping for a magnet but did not see any.

Starts off with friendly security guard and welcoming staff inside. We had ore booked x2 months in advance. We went straight in and are surrounded by Walt’s many awards including his main full size Oscar and x7 small mini oscars for Snow White. The museum was lovingly curated by Walt’s daughter and family. She has put her heart and soul into the space telling the highs, lows, union disputes and start up of the world famous cartoonist. Some lovely family mementos and personal letters, clothes and gifts Walt lavished on Lilian. There is a Tiki Room Parrot you can have a go at programming, a huge moving light up model of Disneyland, interesting film cels that chronologically catalogue EVERYTHING. The toilets are immaculate. There is a separately run cafe. The gift shop has unique items - limited figurines, books and items you can’t buy anywhere else. As the Disney family parted ways with the Walt Disney Organisation many years ago - don’t expect a Disney store type store. It’s mainly WDFM branded items.

You will be fed with lots of information about history of the Walt Disney family, as well as detailed description or narration on the creation of each popular Disney character. I do not recommend it as a destination for families with young kids, although there are some interesting interactive activities (e.g. an activity station demonstrating how animation and sound effects were collaborated in the early days) which may make more sense to early teens. I grew up with lots of Disney cartoons but I am not a huge Disney fan. US$20 for adult general admission is way too high for a specialized museum of this small scale. The Disney family is already making so much profit out of their theme parks and entertainment businesses. I wonder why they still need the public to fund their family museum.

Diane Disney Miller (one of Walt's daughters) and I'm sure many others collaborated in putting all this together. It is excellently done and parts of the exhibit are interactive. (I would not, however, recommend this for young children. They will be bored out of their mind.) Since I am a Walt Disney fanatic I pretty much read through the entire exhibit. It took me 6 hours... so there is plenty to see. Very interesting even if you want to skim. And chock full of family history and memorabilia. In one area it also has an amazing view of the Golden Gate Bridge and San Francisco Bay -- ceiling to floor glass. Staff was very friendly and helpful...although scarce in the actual exhibit areas. So you would have to walk back or far forward to ask a burning question.",5.0

My boyfriend accompanied me and, not being a huge Disney fan, said he really enjoyed it and found out a lot of interesting things he didn't know. There are plenty of things that a Disney fan might already know, whether from going to the parks, watching documentaries, or reading books, but the museum offers so much more with its displays and artifacts. The museum is huge, despite not looking like much from the outside, and took us a good few hours to get through. It nicely flows through Walt's family history and childhood up to his death, covering everything inbetween. There are audio clips to hear and movies to watch, but you can go along at your own pace and skip whatever doesn't interest you. By the end, I was crying like crazy over a man who died almost 50 years ago, but was also very glad I visited. The cost is around 20 dollars and was worth it for me. As others have mentioned, it probably isn't great for babies or kids, as it caters more to adults. I'd say take them to Disneyland to have a better time learning about Walt. That being said, if you're a Disney fan or just curious about the man, and are looking for something different to do in the city, I would definitely check the Family Museum out.",5.0

We just don't see the need to go them any sooner than once every five to ten years. My son however, loves going to Disney, so I wanted to include this museum. I think my husband and I enjoyed it even more. You really gain a understanding of how Walt got started, how revolutionary his ideas were, and how his business grew, starting with nothing. It was easy for me to think he just gained success but Walt really had to work for it. You will learn a lot of things personal to his family, look in awe at all of the Oscars and awards received (and some of the great stories behind them) and see all of the merchandise that was created. We had no idea this was in the Presidio and were stunned at the view of the bay. The only slight negative - the expensive gift shop.

You also come to respect his incredible determination and perserverance over the years, despite repeated setbacks. The sheer range of items on display is amazing. Some are expected--dozens of two- and three-dimensional iterations of Mickey Mouse, for example. But others are unexpected delights--like a nine-page letter written to Disney by Diego Rivera, extolling Mickey as ""one of the genuine heroes of American art in the 20th century,"" or a family snapshot of Walt and Salvador Dali! At the other extreme, in terms of size, is a massive, multi-story camera that Disney's team developed, and a scale-model reproduction of the original layout of Disneyland. Exhibits related to all of Disney's major animated movies will bring back memories for many, and those of some of the recent Disney productions will be interesting to young visitors. But this place is really geared toward an older audience that can appreciate its breadth and scope. We spent three hours there, and wished we'd allotted more time. It's worth repeated visits.",5.0

Walt Disney Family Museum,gosaka,San Jose,CA55,2,Great for Disney Fans,Jul,2011,"This is fantastic museum of all things Walt Disney. I was born in Southern California the same year that Disneyland opened and visited regularly. As an adult I visited Disneyland and watched my kids grow up with all the same old movies and cartoons that I did. As a result, I'm a fan, though not a fanatic. The museum brings all of the history of Walt and his endeavors together in one amazing place. The breadth of his creativity and innovations are impressive. Perhaps even more so is the story of his life, failures, and ultimate successes. Very interesting from a business perspective. It's probably not for young kids (take them to Disneyland) better for teens (if they're interested) and great for adults.",5.0

The nine galleries showing the progression of Walt Disney's life are beautifully laid out, with lots of interactive opportunities and plenty of family mementos and historic documents. The ""techies"" in our group enjoyed learning about the emergence of film animation, as well as the incredible array of cameras which are featured. (Just the right amount of focus is given to television and the development of the theme parks, as well.) And the ""sentimentalists"" among us loved seeing the family films and the ""Lilly-Belle"" train which Mr. Disney built and operated from his own back yard.",5.0

Die unendlich vielen Zeichnungen, die Überlegung der Charaktere, die Auswahl der Musik, die Geräusche sowie das Storyboard machten seine Filme legendär. Hier sieht man wieviel Liebe zum Detail in den einzelnen Szenen steckt. Die Filmklassiker lassen nicht nur Kinderherzen höher schlagen. Die Zeitreise, die man unternimmt, konfrontiert den Besucher auch mit Problemen, die Walt Disney zu bewerkstelligen hatte. Neid und Missgunst sowie Freundschaft und Familienglück begegnet man auf alten Fotographien. Seine Leidenschaft galt Zügen.

We all had so much fun, and many of the machines can be enjoyed by all with one coin. We probably spent $40-50 in quarters (yes, they give change there), between seven of us, so pretty cheap entertainment for a night out in San Francisco. This place was one of a kind for sure! Fabulous that the owners keep these turn of the century antique machines working well and accessible to the public. I would give it more than 5 stars if I could!",5.0

A week later and at 2pm it was a hive of mechanical wonder. There’s ancient to modern elements everywhere you look. Pics attached. People of all ages can be entertained. The overall feeling of the space is sadly drab & run down. It could look a way lot better. For starters the floor - part 1980’s dirty carpet and 50% concrete. You could spend some $ on it and make the whole experience really celebratory and uplifting - the mechanical toys could be put in date order for example. It’s all a bit of a miss-match. Most games are 25/50 cent a go - so it’s s great place to go on your final day of vacation to wave goodbye to all that loose change. We spent a good x30 mins exploring & playing games - even spent $3 on a photo booth. Some of the vintage view finders and hand made scenic reveal ‘toys’ / wonders are great. It is a treasure trove & worth a visit. I would go as far to say - some items should really not be played with anymore & put in a museum. It’s clearly been so,3.0

But then there is the saying that beauty is only sking deep because the Bay is an amazing place and calls you back for ever. Tony Bennet is right when he sings about the world's romantic cities but it's San Francisco where his heart is. Otis Redding (in his song of 1967) was happy to just waste his time sitting here. You will see two bridges (on a good day), the Bay Bridge and Golden Gate Bridge.

Fue un viaje inolvidable, muy movido, donde conocimos muchisimas ciudades, disfrutamos diferentes paisajes, y recorrimos calles que nos fascinaron. Desde Buenos Aires salimos hacia Los Angeles con un itinerario que cumplimos a raja tabla (la unica forma de hacer todo lo que hicimos en 15 dias). Nos instalamos en Hollywood a la vuelta del Chinese Theatre y a un paso del paseo de la fama con sus estrellas y sus personajes sobre las veredas. Si siempre soñaste con conocer Hollywood no te hagas muchas expectativas es un poco decepcionante pero tiene también su encanto. Es importante moverse por los Angeles en auto, todo queda lejos. Podes visitar la playa de Santa Mónica y Venice esta ultima tiene un aire mas bohemio, mientras que la primera es de categoría.

Acabo de volver y fue una experiencia muy buena. El clima en enero fue benigno con nosotros y la media de la temperatura fue de 10 a 15 grados y pleno sol. Nosotros paramos en el Sheraton Fishermann Wharf y quedamos muy conformes con la atención y la ubicación del hotel. Sin grandes lujos pero muy bien ubicado. La zona es muy segura y hermosa para caminar . A una cuadra del hotel partían tanto los famosos tranvías históricos (USD 6 dolares de ida o USD 12 para usarlo todo el día) en que se va sentado de frente y que utiliza los mismos mecanismos hidráulicos que las famosas rejas de las carceles de Alcatraz. Recomiendo sacar en la pagina de Alcatraz con anticipación los tickets que salen unos USD 35 dólares ya que hay mucha gente y llegar temprano al embarcadero. También salen del puerto los tranvías comunes que recorren la ciudad hasta el barrio de El Castro. Recomiendo especialmente el paseo por Alcatraz de noche ; parte a las 4.20hs pm y con audioguías en español fuimos recorriendo la famosa cárcel. El paseo dura unas dos horas y luego se vuelve a la bahía con el atardecer y las luces de la ciudad a pleno . Un experiencia increíble. El segundo día imperdible el paseo en bicicleta por toda la bahía , atravesando el puerto , La base militar Fort Mason y llegando al famosisímo Golden Gate para terminar en la hermosa ciudad de Sausalito. Nosotros no pudimos llegar hasta Muir Woods , donde se pueden ver y tener una idea de lo que es el maravilloso Parque Nacional de las Sequoias. En la ciudad recomiendo recorrer las calles del barrio chino, el castro y Union square. Enfrente de la plaza se encuentra un Macys que en el cuarto piso edificio todo vidriado se pude tomar un café con vista de toda la plaza. San Francisco es hermosa y un lugar privilegiado para vivir.

And virtually all of the city smells like pee! The sidewalks are disgusting, garbage everywhere! This has become more like a 3rd world city! Very sad and disgusting!

San Francisco Bay,Susanah87,Madrid,Spain25,9,Sentirse protagonista de Verano Azul,May,2015,"Montar en bici y ver las cuestas de San Francisco asusta, pero no hay mejor forma de recorrerlo y recorrer su bahía que con ese medio de transporte. Una vez empieza el primer pedaleo no quieres parar y ves como vas recorriendo sitios geniales. Los Pier, el palacio de Bellas artes, la playa ¡y ves el Golden Gate!, pero te piensas la subida porque aquí empiezan las cuestas. Cuando llegas allí hay una explanada para que cojas aire si lo necesitas antes de aventurarte a cruzar el puente. Nosotros tuvimos suerte y nos hizo un día radiante, y lo cruzamos pudiendo ver sin niebla ni nubes todo el paisaje que envuelve a San Francisco. Aunque hay mucha gente y no puedes ir todo lo rápido que te gustaría, no importa porque con todo lo que hay por fotografiar te paras a cada rato para inmortalizar el momento. Una vez pasado, tienes que decidir si irte hacia la naturaleza (hay sendas por las colinas) o hacia Sausalito. Nosotros tiramos para Sausalito porque queríamos llegar a Tiburón para coger un ferry a la Isla Angel y fue una buena elección. Sausalito es un pueblo turístico muy agradable en el que se puede coger el ferry de vuelta a San Francisco. A la salida del pueblo no hay pérdida ya que el carril bici continúa por toda la bahía y vas dejando atrás localidades pequeñas, una avioneta en medio de lo que parece un lago (bueno una masa de agua), campos, lugares para descansar a la sombra, praderas verdes,... ¡y todo esto sin que te molesten apenas los coches! Una vez en Tiburón paramos a comer mientras esperábamos al ferry (una pizza bastante rica aunque un poco salada). Al final no lo pudimos coger porque nos quedábamos sin vuelta a casa, asique lo más deprisa que pudimos hicimos el camino de vuelta para llegar al ferry de Sausalito (tienen muchos horarios).

San Francisco Bay,december52,None,None,roma96,Tre giorni a San Francisco,Sep,2011,"San Francisco è da molti ritenuta una delle poche città americane degne di una visita insieme, naturalmente, a New York. Oltre che a cosa vedere a San Francisco e alle moltissime attrazioni, certamente la fama della città è legata alla sua vocazione tollerante e cosmopolita, e all’alto valore culturale ed architettonico che propone, caratteristiche queste che la rendono la più europea delle città d’oltreoceano. San Francisco è anche riconoscibile, o meglio unica, per le numerose colline su cui si erige e per la bellissima baia da cui si possono ammirare degli spettacolari panorami, che sono un puro piacere visivo, pieni di colori e armonia. Alloggiamo all'Hotel Whitcomb, nella parte centrale di Market Street, un hotel storico dato che dopo il disastroso terremoto del 1906 (seguito da un incendio altrettanto distruttivo) fu una delle poche costruzioni a rimanere intatte e fu eretto a Municipio della Città. Stile liberty all'interno, ma non molto pulito e con personale abbastanza scortese. Dalla camera anzitutto bisogna prenotare un traghetto per Alcatraz; è assolutamente necessario prenotare perchè i traghetti sono sempre pieni e non facendolo si rischierebbe di veder compromessa tutta la scaletta della visita. Alcatraz è un’isola al centro della baia di San Francisco famosa perchè ex sede dell’omonimo carcere di massima sicurezza. Quest’ultimo noto per l’estrema rigidità con cui erano trattati i detenuti e poiché sembrava impossibile ipotizzarne una fuga (da qui prende anche il nome di “The Bastion”). Molti nomi illustri, come Al Capone, passarono parte della loro reclusione in questo carcere. Il nome Alcatraz (che in spagnolo significa “Pellicano“) deriva dai numerosi pellicani presenti nell’isola; questa è anche chiamata “The Rock” poiché un’alta percentuale dell’isola è costituita da roccia. Attraversato questo passaggio fondamentale possiamo anche addentrarci nella scoperta della città. Market Street è un po' il cuore di San Francisco: oltre alle numerose linee di tram i taxi sono frequentissimi, ma come prima uscita preferisco girare a piedi. Catene di negozi e centri commerciali, la stazione della metro e, a Powell street uno dei capolinea della famosa linea di tram che si inerpica sui saliscendi della città. Continuando si attraversa il quartiere finanziario e si arriva all' Imbarcadero da cui si gode un'ottima vista del Bay Bridge e dello skyline della città. Il Bay Bridge, o anche San Francisco Oakland Bay Bridge, è un ponte sospeso della Interstate 80 freeway che attraversa la Baia di San Francisco, collegando la città di San Francisco con la città di Oakland sulla sponda orientale della baia. Il Financial District è il quartiere dove avvengono i più grandi scambi economici e finanziari di San Francisco e di quasi l’intera Baia. La zona è ben riconoscibile anche da lontano perché caratterizzata da un gruppo di grattacieli (il più grande dei quali è la Transamerican Pyramid, la costruzione più alta della città con i suoi 260 metri di altezza; è anche caratterizzata da una particolare forma piramidale con base quadrata che la rende un punto di riferimento del Financial District e uno dei suoi simboli più evidenti.), ed è confinante con la Chinatown e North Beach. Il Financial District è la sede di importanti società e banche, come la Banca d’America e la Wells Fargo, importante gruppo finanziario americano. Dall' Imbarcadero prendiamo il tram che ci porterà al Pier 39; il Pier 39 è un vero e proprio centro commerciale ed un’attrazione turistica costruita su un molo ma è soprattutto famoso per la presenza di numerosi leoni marini della California, attrazione per molte famiglie. Il molo è situato sul bordo del distretto di Fisherman’s Wharf e ospita negozi, una sala video con proiezioni in realtà virtuale tridimensionali, spettacoli di strada, l’acquario cittadino (Aquarium of the Bay), e una giostra veneziana che è una delle maggiori caratteristiche del Pier 39. Inoltre non è raro incontrare per le strade chioschi che vendono frutti di mare, tra cui le vongole ed il granchio di Dungeness. Ci spiegano che arrivare al Golden Gate è particolarmente difficoltoso per via del traffico; optiamo quindi per il taxi anche perchè nonostante siamo ancora in estate, il clima è abbastanza fresco. In effetti la Baia di San Francisco ha un clima tutto particolare; l'aria calda dei vicini deserti arriva qui a scontrarsi con l'aria fredda dell'oceano e si viene a creare una cappa di umidità che genera nebbia e appunto aria abbastanza fresca. Arriviamo col taxi al Golden Gate e, per l'appunto, la sua visione è resa suggestiva proprio dalla coltre di nebbia che lo ricopre in parte. Il Golden Gate Bridge è il simbolo di San Francisco. Il ponte è sospeso sul Golden Gate (il Cancello d’Oro), lo stretto che collega l’Oceano Pacifico con la Baia di San Francisco. Il ponte ha il colore “arancione internazionale” ed è formato da 6 corsie adibite al traffico veicolare e un marciapiede per pedoni e uno per le bici.",5.0

Start anywhere and simply enjoy the city of San Francisco. We begin exploring at the Ferry Building Market Place and continue our walk along the piers and waterside walkways. Then we hit Pier 39 (for the sea lions), Boudin's for traditional sourdough bread, and then walk through Fisherman's Wharf to the historic district and Hyde Street Pier in San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park. *The pier is free if you don't want to board the magnificently restored boats on exhibit.* Aquatic Park Cove is next. The locals love this beautiful urban beach. (There are a few others too!) We always keep going for a stroll on the Municipal Pier. Keep walking up and over the hill if you're of sturdy stock. You'll probably need a car or bike for a trip to Sausalito but it's the perfect place for views of the City by the Bay. Be sure to park the car for a walk across the Golden Gate Bridge and back.

We stayed at the Argonaut Hotel on Jefferson Street which is as close as a hotel gets. You are 100 feet from the bay. Frankly, at first I was not impressed. It is neat to see the Golden Gate Bridge to the west and Alcatraz Island dead ahead but the bay itself didn't impress me. The beach was small and not appealing but I'm comparing this to the Chesapeake Bay. The full beauty and scope of the San Francisco Bay comes to light from different view points. Our tour of Alcatraz, the view from Twin Peaks, the view from the Oakland side all combined to truly impress. This is, indeed, a beautiful and special place.

San Francisco Bay,Minivern,Lake Oswego,OR3,9,SF Bay is Golden,Feb,2015,"SF Bay is lovely and should be part of any SF travel itinerary via land or sea. My husband and I went for a boat ride around the bay last week and thoroughly enjoyed it. We used the Blue & Gold Fleet tour company. The boat was crowded and noisy, but the bay was beautiful! We cruised under the Golden Gate Bridge, and saw a pod of dolphins just to the west of the bridge. The headlands and vistas west of the bridge are lovely and uniquely viewed from a boat. The bridge itself is an architectural wonder and worth seeing from a boat, as well as crossing on foot or on a bike (we rented bikes on a recent visit to SF, rode across the bridge to Sausalito - fantastic views from the bridge - and took a boat back to SF from Sausalito - that was a great experience). After passing under the bridge, our boat turned around and headed back toward the city, making a close pass of Alcatraz Island. During the ride, recorded information about what you are seeing is piped through the boat's speaker system - as we were outside of the boat's cabin and it was a windy day and crowded ride, we had a little difficulty hearing the recording, but what I did hear was informative and interesting. We had a sunny, windy day when we went. It's almost always cooler near or on the water (chilly the day we went), so be sure to take a jacket and dress warmly if you plan a visit to the water, especially if you plan to be on the water and to stay outside of your boat's cabin. If you want a quieter, less crowded cruise, you may want to consider a different tour company, but Blue & Gold was fine for us (easy to use - no reservations required on the day we went with plenty of tour times from which to choose), and we got to see a lot from the boat. Again, whether by land or foot or bike the SF Bay and Golden Gate Bridge are wonders worth seeing!",5.0

You can see Treasure Island, now a navy base, that was home to a World's Fair a century ago.

The San Francisco Bay is enormous. People sail on it, people fish in it, people even swim in it. But the easiest way to enjoy the San Francisco Bay is to look at it. but don't just look at it from the edges, hop aboard one of the San Francisco Bay ferries and take a round trip. Ride from the ferry building up to Vallejo and back. There's no better way to see the amazing diversity in the San Francisco Bay. Take a ferry from the fisherman's wharf area or from the ferry building over to Sausalito. You'll pass by Alcatraz island and the Golden gate bridge. I wouldn't waste my money on one of those circular Bay tours. The boats are overcrowded and they go too slow. I don't think the narration really helps that much. What you really want to do is see the sites of the bay, and take some photographs. But I don't recommend doing in the San Francisco Bay is amateur kayaking.

San Francisco Bay,William McC,Boston,MA36,0,History runs through it,Jul,2019,"The largest estuary in the Americas. Ranges in average depth from less than a foot in the south to hundreds of feet deep at the Golden Gate. A 500-mile(!) trail around the Bay is in the works. And history runs through it. The Ohlone saw the Bay arise thousands of years ago as the glaciers melted. The indomitable Morena may have been the first European to walk through it, on his solo(!) trek from what is now Drakes Bay to what is now Mexico. The California gold rush left a legacy of, among other things, massive amounts of silt. The modern environmental and space preservation movements were born, in part, on the Bay's shores in the 1950s and 60s. There are so many ways to enjoy this massive Bay, but it is best seen on foot, or by bike or boat, with a myriad of trails and launching sites available, as well as paid Bay tours and the like. You could easily spend many years exploring this splendid region, and still feel, happily, like you are just getting started.",5.0

Legion of Honor,Live2TravelReview,Eagle River,AK38,9,"Fantastic collection, but dangerous parking lot",Dec,2014,"A stunning location atop a woodsy hill overlooking the entrance to San Francisco Bay. Views of the Golden Gate bridge, the water, sculptures and the fountains can lull you into a false sense of security. The Legion of Honor holds exquisite collections in a gorgeous building and we enjoyed an excellent lunch at the museum cafe. We exited and found a thief had smashed in the rear window of our new car and had stolen our backpack and camera gear (which was on the floor out of sight). The most disappointing fact was that when we went inside to notify museum security staff and call the police, we were handed a small 5x7 card notifying us that a rash of break-ins were occurring. Had we known this when we were parking - or even paying the entrance fee - we'd have chosen to bring in our bags. The entrance is a long distance from the parking lot. A sign IN the parking lot warning of break-in activity; a security guard in the parking area; or even visible security cameras monitoring this parking lot would be a more proactive, responsible way to demonstrate concern for the safety of museum guests. Very disappointed that a known problem is not proactively worked and that each guest is not notified of the ""rash"" of break-ins. We lost our expensive camera gear and feel lucky that only the car was damaged. Thieves actively working a parking lot such as this can easily escalate to armed robbery or physical violence. The Legion staff needs to chose a more visible method of addressing the problem.",4.0

A guy attempted to take my camera from behind me while I was taking pictures of the skyline at the parking lot. (My back was facing the parking lot and the museum. Too bad I don't have eyes on my back.) I suppose I held on to my camera too tight for the perpetrator. He gave up and ran back into a black Infiniti, his getaway vehicle. (There were at least two people involved.) This happened in daylight with two witnesses right behind me. The parking lot is round. Almost all cars are parked head-in. Visitors can get a good 180 view of the skyline even without getting out of their cars. A few minutes before this attempted robbery, I noticed that this getaway vehicle was parked back-in. It was a nice car. Its engine was quietly running, but I could smell the exhaust. In hindsight, it is clear what these criminals were up to. I called SFPD and filed a report. They asked me if I would like to wait for an officer to get there, but they also said they didn't know when an officer would show up. I said I wasn't interested in waiting for the officer, since the person on the phone couldn't tell me what the police officer could do for me or for the place. I especially was not interested in waiting there since the sun had just set. Waiting for an officer with an unknown arrival time in the dark in this place?

However, we parked at Legion of Honor and walked up to the building waiting for it to open. In the short time we had our backs to the parking lot, our rental car was broken into by thieves that apparently frequent the lot. They smashed in the passenger side windows. The Legion of Honor has no cameras in its lot or signs warning of frequent break-ins. You will see signs like this at other sites in San Francisco. We asked for help in the museum when it opened. They gave us a card with resources on what to do after your car was broken into. So, they are well aware of the problem but take no measures to protect their visitors.

His portraiture skills are at least as compelling as Singer Sargent's; his seascapes rival J.M.W. Turner's; and his crowd scenes are perhaps more witty than a Degas or Renoir of that period. Overall, Tissot's technical brilliance is on display in virtually every painting, sketch and art piece here. Sadly, the docent who led our tour, while pleasant in manner, added very little to the captions on the wall. It's too bad when docent staff do not rise to the level of the art--the goal should be to help us understand why great art is great in a historical context, but more than that, to help us have a conversation with the art itself, to let it speak to us in the present day.

Every object is given space and light so that visitors can see and savour all that they have to offer. The labelling is careful, clear, and non-intrusive. But it was the light that made this visit so remarkable for me. The use of natural lighting in the ceramics area, especially, just astounded me with the calm and beauty it created in the galleries. Paintings and decorative arts are mixed in many of the galleries, to give the visitor an idea of the milieu in which both existed when they were created.

Inside the museum, you will find the works of many masters as part of the permanent collection. I went for the special exhibits. Currently, there are two. One is Klimt and Rodin, two of my personal favorites. These two artists were contemporaries, both rebels of their time, and both created very sensual art. The other exhibit is Color of the Gods. FABULOUS!!! We are used to seeing the sculptures of the Greeks and Romans as beautiful white marble. But those beautiful white marbles were not seen by the Greeks and Romans. What they saw were brightly painted marble. This exhibit focuses on recreating those colorful sculptures based on sophisticated techniques and research. My friend and I spent 5 hours at the museum. We spent about an hour at each special exhibit. We took the docent tour (45 minutes) of the antiquities exhibit. There is no docent tour of Klimt and Rodin, but there was a 45 minute lecture.

It is located in a beautiful area called Lincoln Park and my wife and I also walked through Golden Gate Park to get there. Walking home we took a trail along the Pacific coast and stopped by the 19th century ruins of the Sutro Baths. The objective of that day's adventure in San Francisco was to see the artwork, but the natural beauty that we encountered coming and going made it a particularly exceptional day. I had been to the DeYoung Art Museum on a previous visit to the city. If I were to be given a choice of which museum to visit, I'd choose the Legion of Honor for its generally older artwork (although mixed in with contemporary art) over the more modern DeYoung, but both are worthwhile.

She kept telling us how ""beautiful"", ""exquisite"", and ""intimate"" the painters were. I knew the name of the show; Intimate Impressionism, so she really didn't need to describe almost every canvas as ""intimate"". She confused Seurat and Pissaro. Okay, a small mistake. But she kept misidentifying the artists and I finally took off my headset and wandered off to experience the show without her help.

Lastly, at the end of our visit, around 4:00, they offered a free organ concert. I had noticed the organ earlier and wondered about it. I love organ music but had to leave after the first song, unfortunately. The concert was titled, ""Organ Pop Music"", or something similar. A nice twist to typical organ concert music.",5.0

You have over 1,400 acres of trails, woods with grown cypress, eucalyptus trees. The Presidio is also home to Lucas films and Walt Disney's Granddaughter opened a Museum in honor of her Grandfather Walt Disney called the Disney Museum. On Sundays during the spring the park hosts Off The Grid, where a lot of food trucks come in to serve the public. The Park is full of San Francisco and California History. Presidio park has tours to learn more in depth of the history there. also the park has two high end hotels Inn At The Presidio & Lodge At The Presidio both are stunning and perfect places to unwind after a day of trails and exploring. Great restaurants like The Commissary and Social Club for dining. There's even a bowling alley and Theater in the park.

For example we made the 10 min walk over to a real treat for Star Wars fans ILM, which is on the property, You can have your picture taken with a statue of Yoda. Following this we walked over to where the old Officer Club is located which has its own unique history and has a great Mexican restaurant Arguello that’s great for lunch.

I started off my day around noon, and my first stop was the Walt Disney Family Museum. There was so much parking, I thought the whole place was closed - everything was so quiet. I parked in the main post lot and parking all day was $7 (Or $1 something an hour-unheard of). After the museum, I walked the Presidio Promenade trail all the way to the Golden Gate Bridge. There were some bikers, a couple runners and some other walkers but it was not busy at all on a Friday afternoon. It was so quiet and peaceful most of the way but it does more crowded as you get closer to the bridge. I spent some time at the Golden Gate Bridge and took the PresidiGo shuttle back to the main lot-which is totally free. They also have a shuttle that goes downtown. This would be a great place to start your day, park all day for cheap, and take the shuttle to and from downtown. There is some construction going on down by the stables, but they still kept most of the trail and sidewalks clear. If you want some quiet outdoor time away from the fast pace of the city- I would definitely suggest coming here!",5.0

From there another free bus will drive you over to the Golden Gate Bridge for those active types who'd like to walk or bike across the bridge. And the staff at the Visitors' Center are kind, knowledgeable, and helpful beyond the call of duty. Kimmi watched over a poster I bought there while we were traipsing across the bridge.

Opted for the more difficult option, walked up Telegraph Hill using the Filbert steps. Took the route from Embarcadero near Pier 19 through Levi’s Plaza up to the base of Filbert steps. It’s a challenging walk up but you do get some wonderful vistas of the bay towards the Bay Bridge and see some very nice houses whose only access is from the steps. Took a leisurely 30 minutes to get up to Coit Tower. Once at the base of the tower, you do get some good views of the City and the bay but would recommend spending the USD10 to go up the lift to the top of the tower. There u have views not blocked by trees of the whole city and Bay Area especially the Transamerica Building. Had the option of taking the bus down but decided on taking Lombard Street down towards Fisherman’s Wharf. All in all a great 3 hours spent to get a feel for the geography of San Francisco.",4.0

When you get inside, you can see all the great murals that were commissioned for the building with som many different artists so skillfully working with each other to make the murals almost continuous. When you get inside, you need to pay the fee by the gift shop to go up the elevator and masks are required. At the top, it is open to the sky, so there is a lip at the top they warn you about.

But keep in mind you don’t get the full 360 degree view of SF from the parking lot (shrubbery blocks much of the view unless you stand on the railing). With all that said, for me, the best part of the experience is the chance to view the 1930s murals around the inside of the tower which depict life and work in Depression Era California.

We locked our vehicle and kept it within our view while we took a few pictures of the monument. A vehicle drove into the parking lot and stopped behind our rental. A man got out, peered into our window and when we yelled at him to get away he instantly smashed the window, grabbed two bags containing mine and my husband's ID, credit cards and cash plus some other items. Within seconds he jumped back into his vehicle and the four men sped out of the parking lots nearly running down myself and others.

They only have one elevator going up. It’s the same way to go down. You have to wait in line just to go down. I didn’t care for the elevator operator who was operating the elevator going down though. She wasn’t very friendly and she appeared to have a bad attitude. She yelled at my son just because his mask wasn’t completely over his face. It didn’t cover his nose, and she was real nasty about it. Not sure what her problem was but that was the one thing I did not like about the coit tower. The elevator operator!

This little gem should be on every visitor and local's must see list. The 210-ft tower is located in Pioneer Park at the top of Telegraph Hill and can be seen from most neighborhoods in the city. The tower was built with money donated by Lillie Hitchcock Coit, a wealthy and eccentric socialite, after her death 1929. Lillie was a big fan of the city's firefighters (like most ladies) and probably would have become one if she wasn't a woman born in the 1800s. Its rumored that she was a woman born before her times as she often wore pants and smoked cigars. Oh good heavens! After her death, she wanted to honor the city and its firefighters by building a monument to beautify the city. Although Coit Tower looks like a fire hose nozzle, the original designers say this is just a coincidence. Her money was also used to build a monument of three firefighters carrying a woman. To this day, Lillie is the patron saint of San Francisco firefighters.",4.0

Coit Tower,Erin C,Ontario,Canada4,0,Was just ok,Jul,2018,"We saw that tower once we drove into downtown San Francisco and decided we wanted to go check it out. There is very limited parking, 15 about 15-20 spots at the actual tower, the rest of the parking you need to drive around to try and get lucky. We got luck at were able to park at the base of the hill. We climbed the hill to the steps of the tower and waited in line. There was a lady directing people but there were no signs to say there was a cover charge. We stood in the line outside for about 15 minutes before we were able to get in and then realized we needed to pay $9/person to go up the tower. We then had to stand in another line for over an hour just to use the elevator to go up as the max amount of people in the elevator is 10 people once at the almost top you then have about 37 steps to climb (that was fine for us, but they should let people know as some of the seniors had a hard time with the stairs as they are very tiny and narrow. Once at the top, it is very small and not a lot of room to maneuver. The views however are breathtaking. You can look out any window and see the beautiful city of San Francisco, however they only have one window open per section so you are fighting with everyone else trying to look out the window. Not really sure if it was worth the money and wait time though.",3.0

I figured it would be an hour because TripAdvisor said it was less than a 1 hour experience I knew there would be a line because we were going in the afternoon, but this was a LINE.

Coit Tower,Tony MacKay,Toronto,Canada31,7,Worth the effort - Great Views of the Bay Area,May,2015,We almost passed on this stop on our self guided tour but on the last day checked it out. Limited parking at the top but two accessible parking spots. Nice views from the grounds even without going up the tower which is 21 stories by modern measure or 13 stories from the era it was built in. There are accessible access ramps to get in to the main level with murals which is free. It is $8 ea admission to get to the top of the tower via elevator but it stops short so you have 20+ steps up to the top from there. At the elevator top they do have a private wheelchair access balcony for a North view. Bay area views are amazing and far better than Twin Peaks so for iconic images Coit Tower is worth the effort. Unlike most city views there are no buildings in the way. Great historical part of Old San Francisco to enjoy and nice high view picture of the twisty Lombard Street to the NW. Lombard pretty much starts/ends at the base of the tower hill.,5.0

The tickets for the elevator ride to the top are $5.00 per person, and when we went to the little retail stand to buy them, I asked the proprietor what the best way to get down from Telegraph Hill was, since we had taken a cab up. He told us to ""walk down the stairs, all of the stairs in the front, then turn left and walk down the stairs."" I said, ""I saw a ramp that people were walking their dog coming up..."" and he literally screamed, ""You want me to tell you? You know how to get down there? If you know, why did you ask?

Their brewery is relatively small, but it boasts a great history, as shared by our wonderful tour guide Denny. His vast knowledge of Anchor, the city, and the brewing process made for an excellent tour. The tour was part history lesson, part explanation of Anchor's unusual brewing process, and part cultural story about a brewery that nearly went out business only to come back with national and world-wide prominence. It's a friendly tour where you get to see and meet the workers and watch them doing their jobs. Since it's not a slick multimedia charade with screens and a self-guided approach, you come away feeling like it's a brewery that you're happy to support. Our tour featured 12 beers that we could taste, each with its own personality and history. I've been on this tour twice and have enjoyed each one very much -- way more than the glitzy tour at Guinness.",5.0

So if you've seen it before, you've seen it. But then, back to the tap room for more information from Joey about each of the six beers we tasted.

We thought the cost of $15 per person was a little high, but as we found out on the tour, it was worth it when it came to the tastings. When we arrived, we were directed to the bar/pub upstairs and told to wait there for the tour to start. So we waited with everyone else in the bar while the workers periodically came in to get a cold beer to drink (it would have been nice if we could buy a pint while we waited).The actual tour was a little short, but it was cool seeing the cooper kettles they use in the process. After the tour, the tastings began. We got to taste 8 different beer and they were all good. The bar they built is pretty cool, with a lot of beer memorabilia around. After the tastings, they open it up to purchase Anchor swag. It was a great afternoon and well worth the price. They also have a photo booth so you can post a picture to facebook.

The tour guide was actually really really good, passionate and knowledgeable like only a true geek can be. But the building and the two or three rooms you go to have very little to offer in the was of history, atmosphere or charm. I can only figure they get such good ratings based on three things: its free, you get to drink about two pints worth at the end, the reviewers have not been on a really good tour.",3.0

However, the TAP ROOM was open, YEA, and you could quaff at your pleasure. I did. All the executives from across the street were in the tap room working and I met the COO, Craig. ( My apologize if it is misspelled or I misheard your name. You are still an A-1 man ! ) Sandy, was the beertender on day one. He was most knowledgeable about the Anchor product and quided through some tastings and my selections of pints and half-pints. Oh yeah, the sud flowed and I cleaned it up. Their IPA's were fantastic. I don't have the menu in front of me but these were mostly special brews and a few were staples. I went back the next day and met a man from Poland and we sat and quaffed several beers and talked about the difference between European and American style beers. San Francisco is very cosmopolitan and culturally diverse. So, please go visit Anchor Brewing it is worth your time to go by, taste a few, but please drink responsibly, meet great people and have a fantastic time doing so.

The tour was about 30-45 minutes with each process explained, then came the tasting... All I can say is laid back, chilled, and very down to earth. This must be a cool place to work, the folks here seem very enthused with the company... A good bit of history and an interesting variety of products... Well worth the time...",5.0

It just shows that one might be able to buy a few good works with money, but never a good collection. At $25 entry and no student discount, this museum is just for over-privileged fake people. The topmost gallery with German works by the likes for Gerhard Richter was interesting, but the lower levels were populated with American pop and other 'american modern' works that could be best described as junk! They were all pointless assaults on aesthetics. The best bit of the museum is the building. Mario Borta's entrance hall is impressive, and the new extension's wavy concrete facade is interesting. The huge green wall feature and the cafe terrace were however closed-off due to 'wet weather', despite no rain at the time. So best avoid on a rainy day altogether. The ticketing staff also failed to inform that an entire level was closed-off, along with some temporary gallery spaces. The staff at the reception could be best described as arrogant, unhelpful, and withholding information that is vital to a museum visit.

Why didn’t the ticket salesperson tell us we needed further admission? We mentioned to them we wanted to view that particular work of art. Felt really robbed of 80 bucks.

One of the better displays was the section on photography (Floor 3), especially the exhibition entitled ‘Don’t! Photography and the Art of Mistakes’.

I instantly created some examples of my own using reflections, shadows and crops in the sculpture garden outside the museum cafe.

Very cool looking architecture slap bang in the middle of down town San Francisco. Paid $37 to enter and the added charge for the Warhol Exhibition. I’d say that out prices a lot of people which is a shame. The galleries are litter free with plenty of staff guarding the treasures..... but here’s a thing - We travelled from the UK on vacation and saw an iconic ‘LOVE’ sculpture on a roof garden. There were a handful of people sat here - but the closest was a security guard on his mobile phone. We asked if he would be kind enough to take a photo.... he point blank refused. We asked why not. He just laughed and shrugged his shoulders. Hopefully you have CCTV of this - approx 15:00 on 7.7.19. - It genuinely ruined our day at the museum. Are the security not given BASIC CUSTOMER SERVICE TRAINING ?!!!!!! - I’m guessing not - maybe the SFMOMA can direct message me to discuss this further. The guard in question is picture #7 on here - I suggest you have a word. If we would of had time we would of queued longer at guest services but the staff were too busy mocking an old lady who had lost her glasses (!) - I’m not even joking. The Warhol Exhibition was outstanding - charting the obvious and not so obvious classics from his back catalogue. Pics attached. This is the 2nd Warhol exhibition I have seen in the past x2 years and this was far more extensive and beautifully curated. Staff member at the end of the exhibition sat on a stool reading a book with little/no interaction was poor. Needs looking at. There are also rude elements of the Warhol exhibition but the only warning for parents seems to be just x10 feet from the rude topic sketches. Some parents were quite verbal in expressing their concerns. Maybe make this a bit more obvious at the start of the exhibition ? - just a thought. - The Warhol shop is expensive overall - $300 for a roll of Warhol wall-paper, $499 for a Warhol BRILLO cube stool, $600 for x3 Warhol printed skateboards, & the odd $22 silver foil thin watch, $30 dominoes and $20 notebooks. The Beach Blanket Babylon roof terrace was disappointing - needs attention too. I imagine Steve Silver would be pretty underwhelmed with what this space had on offer today - don’t you ?Toilets were clean. The main gift shop is MASSIVE and there are helpful staff on standby - $600 clocks, plastic jewellery $15 to children’s books and even light up banana lamps from SELETI. Pics attached. We spent x2 hours here but could of easily stayed for x4. Go and explore. Managers - go and mystery shop the venue and get some feedback from guests - you’ll learn loads if you view this institution through the eyes of your guests. Happy to provide and expand on this feedback. Would I recommend this museum ? - The answer is Yes but it’s a 2/5 rating for the reasons listed.",3.0

I just go for fun hoping to see something jaw-dropping as I turn the corner. The museum was ""standard"". Mostly paintings/pictures and a small number of sculptures/objects on the floor. Nothing ""blew me away"" but had a good time regardless. Yes, they boast 7 floors but each floor is not huge. In SF, land is precious so they had to build up with multiple floors with smaller footprints. It was also stuffy in there as a lot of people were taking off their jackets. Don't know if they had the heat on high or was it because heat rises to the upper floors. Nevertheless, everyone should go at least once for the experience. Let's talk about security based on my observations on this particular day - It costs $25 to get in and while I did pay, I hate paying to get into museums. I think they made enough profit to let me in for free! Ha! Ha! After visiting a museum, I like to evaluate how tight was their security. After you pay on the 2nd floor, most people go to the elevators that take you up to the upper floors. But before you do, your ticket is checked. Quite normal. But on this 2nd floor there are 2 entrances, distanced far apart, that lead to exhibits that doesn't require an elevator ride. The odd thing is that there was a ticket checker at one of the entrances but not at the other. In other words, anyone without a ticket could enter at the entrance without the ticket checker. I saw many unticketed patrons in this exhibit area. Most wandered in there because no one stopped them. Now, in this area there is a doorway that leads to stairs that take you up to the 2nd floor. If you can get past this doorway, you would have full access to the museum as this staircase leads to the paid area of the museum. Ok, yes, they did have a ticket checker watching the doorway but this person walked away for a few minutes at a time, leaving the doorway unattended. As I watched, some unticketed patrons were walking through this doorway, not knowing they are getting in the museum for free! So MOMA SF, if you are reading this, you gotta put a ticket checker on both exhibit entrances on the 2nd floor. I know you let the under 18 crowd go in for free so maybe you don't care if a few adults get free too. I don't know. Maybe you were short staffed that day but you certainly had plenty of security guards watching patrons behave themselves on the museum floors. I'm sure you can spare one to watch the door.",3.0

This is not that place. The zen garden had been ravaged by an abundance of squirrels (we counted 8 in the sand area alone). They had completely ruined the straight lines in the sand. The ponds were filled with fallen leaves and other debris. Given it was December, it’s obvious there is either a severe shortage of caretakers or a lack of attention to details.

Unfortunately, the service staff could not wait to close shop and go home. They served our tea (including our miso soup!) in paper coffee cups, which completely ruined the whole experience.

We complained with the same waiter and the guy acted like he didn't know what we were talking about... the other families were white, we are latin, so we can only say that this was an act of racism against us which is sad, because just a couple of minutes ago we had been celebrating and admiring the Japanese culture.",1.0

Once inside, you see some nice Japanese decor and the tea shop (which is pricey) and then the ponds with koi (that weren't very active and looked sick). The Zen garden area was small. The pagoda was nice. The bridge was a hassle to climb. I believe it's for decor mostly because other than that you've got to work to get up on top for a photo and then climb back down. Very steep.

Even though one of the three floors is currently closed for remodeling, there is still plenty to see. I highly recommend taking a docent-led tour. Ours was one of the best that I had ever taken at a museum. The theme of the tour was representations of Buddha and how they had varied across time periods and regions. What made the tour excellent was that the tour was a mixed group of people from Western backgrounds, India, and China. The docent got the tour participants to share their perceptions on the different images of Buddha.

It was suitable for newcomers to Asian art and probably satisfying for the specialist viewer. The contemporary works were as interesting as the very ancient. The age and condition of some works was mind boggling. The revamped cafe was having a soft opening and was nonetheless delicious. A great salad was my choice. The matcha latte was novel and for me possibly an acquired taste. Look in the shop which has some quality gifts and mementoes.

Remarks re Han Dynasty Special Exhibit,Apr,2017,"Our family of 1 tween, 1 teen, and 3 adults visited the museum today to view the ""Tomb Treasures"" from the Han Dynasty (on view through May). Overall, it was a spectacular exhibit and featured exquisite jade, gold, and bronze figurines and common items (like cooking vessels and lamps) that the nobility used. There were also short videos explaining and demonstrating the types of weaponry and forms of entertainment during the Han dynasty. It was mind-boggling to realize that for an ancient civilization existing before AD even began, the nobility had intricate musical instruments and even wine containers. The reason I'm giving this exhibit 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because in the third room, I inwardly screamed ""Ai Yah!"" (Yikes in Chinese). I was SHOCKED that they had sexual toys on display. Shocked that they used these sort of things back then but SHOCKED that I had to think about whether I wanted my children to view such things and ask me questions about them. Instead I chose to tell them the third room was off limits. So parents, I just want to warn you so you won't be shocked like me.",4.0
Asian Art Museum,JazzmomChicago_IL,Chicago,IL1,4,Right up there with the Musee Guimet in Paris.,Feb,2017,"Internationally known, this museum is welcoming and user-friendly. The encyclopedic collection encompasses Southeast Asia, India, China, Japan,a little of the Middle East, and Korea, spread across three levels, beautifully displayed. It used to be housed in a wing of the de Young Museum in Golden Gate Park, but about ten years ago moved to the city's former main public library, a Beaux Arts building across from the Civic Center. You can still see the grand staircase of the old library with wonderful art-related quotes high on the walls. A delightful contemporary Chinese sculpture, ""Suspended Letters,"" at the top of the staircase takes its inspiration from some of the quotes. The audio guides as well as the written material in the museum gives a lot of helpful and engaging information, including legends and history. We thought we knew the ""basics"" yet got a lot of Hindu gods sorted out and are now much better readers of Buddhist symbols! We took a break from the galleries and had lunch at the Cafe Asia on the first floor. Despite being a ""cafeteria,"" the room is serene and a pleasant place to recharge. The menu is limited but everything looked good. I had an excellent chicken coconut soup and my husband had a sweet pumpkin curry--although both were delicious and beautifully presented, they were enormous portions we couldn't finish. Each black molded table had one or two fresh yellow calla lilies in a gourd-shaped vase and small potted palm trees created separate seating spaces in the room, making it feel more intimate. Had we been in San Francisco longer, we would have returned a second day; the museum isn't huge, but the collection was too much for us to absorb in one visit.",5.0

Asian Art Museum,Mark51SF,San Francisco,CA1,2,Something for everyone at this Museum,Mar,2016,"I am a long time member of the Asian Art Museum. It is my favorite museum on the City and one of the great museums for Asian art outside of Asia. Formerly housed inside another museum in Golden Gate Park, the Museum now makes its home in the beaux arts building that was formerly the main library of San Francisco. The building has been extensively remodeled. There is usually a special show on the first floor along with a gift shop (a great place for an unusual gift) and Cafe Asia (a great place for lunch). The museums own collection is housed on the floors above. They feature very old pieces but are also in touch with modern Asian art. As they are currently celebrating their 50th Anniversary (2016) there are some special shows planned. The museum has a very strong outreach to local schools so the fun educational element is available for the kids. There is underground parking under the park between the museum and City Hall. Visiting the museum gives you an opportunity the see the beaux art heart of San Francisco with City Hall, Davies Symphony Hall, the War Memorial Opera House, and the Main Library. The area around the library does seem to be a hangout for the homeless. There is also a craft / farmers market nearby. It is close to Muni underground stops. Cafe Asia in the museum is available for lunch (cleanest restrooms in the City...worth the price of admission!). If you want to venture a few blocks to the north for lunch there are some very good and inexpensive Vietnamese and Thai places. If you are in the City for a few days, i would recommend you add it to your list.",5.0

Two hours is a minimum time needed to browse some of the most interesting artifacts. Indian Hindu and Buddhist sculptures seem to predominate, followed by extensive Chinese Buddhas. The distinction between ancient northern and southern Indian cultures came through very clearly in the well done explanations and displays. There were also intriguing sidelights such as a case with ornate carved rhino horn cups (now we know why there are fewer than 300 living Sumatran rhinos living in the world today!), a nice example of a well preserved set of Japanese samurai armor, and carved jade and other semiprecious stone carvings (including an intriguing jade ""wish granting wand""). There was a noticeable scarcity of some other ancient Asian cultures (e.g., Korean) and other forms of art but the sculptures were inspiring and fascinating. Very well organized and presented collection! (Free entry to active duty military and one guest).",5.0

San Francisco Botanical Garden,Mark L,San Francisco,CA8,5,Quiet Respite Any Time of Year,Dec,2015,"The San Francisco Botanical Gardens are an outgrowth of the Strybing Arboretum, a fixture in Golden Gate Park for many years. Now, as the botanical gardens, the laudable landscapers and caretakers have added many themed gardens to the experience, e.g., from geological periods to countries of origin for plants. I walk for exercise every day, and I walk the botanical gardens regularly. There is always something new to look at. From the garden of native California plants to the great meadow and fountain plaza, there are surprises around every turn. Something is always blooming, the leaves turn colors on deciduous trees in fall, and there are numerous spots to sit and just be. Take your pick; a garden of succulents to pools of lotus and water lilies. There's even a garden dedicated to fragrances. Located adjacent to the Japanese Tea Garden, both sites can be visited easily in one afternoon. The deYoung Museum and Academy of Sciences are also a short walk away. The botanical gardens offer an island of tranquility literally in the middle of a big city. If you can't get north to see redwoods, the botanical garden's redwood grove gets you up close and personal with the iconic giants. Myriad other kinds of trees are everywhere owing their existence to the Strybing family and the establishment of the original arboretum. One can visit areas of the gardens which feel quite wild and natural, other areas are formal as one might expect. The gardens are free to citizens of the city of San Francisco, but there is a nominal charge for visitors. The variety of living things one can see is astonishing.",5.0

I'm from Hong Kong and lived in Mainland China for more than 20 years, which was why I wanted to see what it was like for FOBs when they first arrived to America, and based on what I saw in Chinatown, SF, I am proud to say that living in China is a lot better than living in America... at least for a Chinese person. If this Chinatown was meant to be ""home base"" for Chinese people living in this city, I can understand why nobody wants to stick around. There was absolutely no sense of vibrance as a quarter of shops were closed, and those that were open didn't seem very welcoming with their staggering prices for food and drinks. Souvenir shops were selling Mao-related stuff and cheap toys that made a lot of noise, which I haven't seen in China since the early 2000's. If I had to compare, I would say this place resembles China back in the 80s minus the lanterns and cheesy signs, and has frozen in time since, which is probably why some people to this day think China is still really backward.",1.0

When we were window shopping, a salesman came out of his store and tried to sell us a $3000 life sized statue of a cheetah, saying that it was a very good price.

Chinatown,cauchemarlover,San Francisco,CA5,1,"If You Want to see the real San Francisco, come with an open mind",Jul,2011,"From a native's point of view, San Francisco's Chinatown is not a tourist attraction, rather it is a neighborhood. Truth be told, it is a ghetto, a place where the newest immigrants, illegals, and the poor make their home. Yes, there is historic window dressing for the tourists and a unique Chinese merchant-class layered on top of the ghetto, but it is a ghetto in the best sense of the word and a unique sight, with features unlike any other Chinatown in North America. Yes, it is crowded, dirty, noisy, overpopulated, with rude people and ruder storekeepers, with homeless beggars and opportunistic thieves. Chinatown is a different world within San Francisco, and if it hits you the wrong way, recognize that you are experiencing culture shock. for it is a different culture entirely that is on display in this gritty, real place. It is not a Disney ride! The best advice I read here is to explore Stockton St., the main drag for locals, and the side streets that criss cross Grant St. There is good food here, but look for a crowded place full of locals, not tourists. If you want atmosphere, many of the big restaurants on Grant St. will give you a taste of Chinatown, but the hole in the wall places will give you a more authentic experience. If you are looking for a show, or a tourist-friendly Americanized destination, you will not find it here--fabulous souvenir shops notwithstanding. If you want to experience one of San Francisco's authentic and historic neighborhood, come and walk around for an hour or two and bring an open mind and heart.",5.0

The merchants are overanxious watching any merchandise on sidewalk with all of the vagrants everywhere. Has gone waaay downhill since 2008. The vagrants, addicts, and panhandlers have now taken this area over and made it their home. I no longer recommend this as a tourist attraction, PERIOD. San Francisco has become a ridiculously expensive, dirty place to visit, and many tourist attractions are now sanctuary places for addicts and vagrants, and they simply lost the formula for a tourist destination; they just let take over and turn everything to filth. Parking areas very dangerous, dark, dirty; parking garages hire security guards posted on each level to watch your cars from getting broken into, and parking in garages ridiculously expensive.

Chinatown,John H,Waxahachie,TX96,9,One of the Most Vibrant & Diverse Areas of San Francisco!,Jun,2016,"Every major urban hub in our country has various areas that are the centerpiece of the diverse ethnic cultures that constitute our unified American culture. It is always one of the pleasures of travel to experience the differences in aesthetics, activities, & of course culinary delights that correspond with this diversity. Anyone visiting a large city who avoids these areas is really missing some special experiences that would generally enhance any travel experience. San Francisco's Chinatown is the largest organized community of Chinese heritage outside of Asia, & it's the oldest Chinatown in North America. Since San Francisco was the primary port of entry for Chinese immigrants & workers during the 19th century, it was only natural & convenient for the city government to designate the perimeter boundaries for the huge population of Chinese arrivals. The core of the development of Chinatown consisted of two factors that created the huge immigration of Chinese into California between 1850 & 1900: the increasing need for unskilled or semi-skilled labor to work laying track for the Central Pacific Railroad as the western branch of the Transcontinental Railroad that President Grant strongly advocated; &, the fact that the city designated an area of land in San Francisco in which Chinese immigrants could legally buy & deed land from the city & private land owners. Thus, a growing & prospering Chinese group of merchants & providers of goods & services to their own ethnic group along with business extensions into San Francisco established the capital basis for a stable integrated Chinatown. The Chinatown of today is resplendent with its own holiday celebrations, colorful decorations, & iconic Oriental designs in both art & architecture. It is a great place to visit, & especially to eat!",5.0

Chinatown,LimoBunny,Beverly Hills,CA3,9,Crazy Fun!!!,Mar,2015,Okay where do I start. I have been coming to the San Francisco's Chinatown since I was a child with my parents. My suggestion is to start at the front gates of Chinatown and walk into Michael's antiques. The furniture and the antiques are simply beautiful and great prices. Once you walk out of there you'll just bumped into so many different stores with different Asian artifacts but besides my favorite antique store you must walk into L.D. JEWELRY. I simply love those jewelry store and the prices here are just incredibly priced. The owner Rich and his wife own the place and they are the nicest people and extremely honest which is rare to find. Now for true authentic Chinese food in Chinatown you must go to R & G Lounge. This place has true authentic Chinese food that is not Americanized.,5.0

Start at the intersection of Bush and Grant and you'll find the Chinatown Gate designed by architect Clayton Lee in 1970. Great photo op! I spent almost 4 hours walking down the various streets, hunting for murals on sides of buildings and going in and out of different shops. A great place to take pics - love the colors on Waverly Place. If you want a haircut for $5 go there and you can choose from a couple of different boutiques. Eastern Bakery is on 720 Grant - go and try a moon cake. President Clinton did! Play hide and seek with Ross Alley...once you find it you will find the Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Company! Free samples and a bag of cookies for $3 plus they sell bottle water. I walked all over this place and really got a good workout!

Chinatown,CovingtonCat,Covington,KY54,7,"Fun, if you don't take it seriously",Jun,2013,"It's been a long while since I last visited San Francisco and Chinatown. Some things don't change (much). Visiting Chinatown should be done as an adventure - you're site-seeing, maybe trying a new food, not spending a lot of money to do it. First off, don't buy something in the first shops you visit near the gate on Grant. You'll probably find the same items farther up Grant for a little less money. Not much less, but still less. You'll find some of the same items in several stores. There are some stores selling high-priced luxury items and many selling tourist kitsch items. Window shop the first, go into the latter. You'll thank me later. Get all your t-shirts here since they'll be cheaper than anywhere else. But check them out closely to be sure you're not getting a second. Walk up one side of Grant, then return on the other. Have fun.",4.0

It features most of the cheap tourist offerings. If you want to really enjoy Chinatown you must get off Grant street at least for an hour or so. Stockton has some great family-run eateries and some great places to browse live food stores. See the live frongs, Ducks, pheasents, quail, chickens, etc. View a butchered pig where every single part is for sale. Visit a Chinese herbal store and see the many offerings and learn what they are used to treat. If you cook and want a true experience get some pepper berries or ""Prickly Ash"" for your Asian meals at the herbal store. Try to find that at your home megamart! Sit in the park just North of Grant street and watch the locals enjoy the out of doors and their friends, and family. Grant street has much to offer such as the Far East Cafe and the Eastern Bakery at 720 Grant that has tremendous egg custard tarts and a great take out dim sum you can heat in your microwave at the your hotel.

Chinatown,Andrea H,Albuquerque,NM6,0,NOT impressed!,Mar,2013,"From what I'd heard about Chinatown in San Francisco, I was expecting a place with grand Chinese architecture, authentic restaurants and lots of things to see and do. I had planned on spending at least half a day here and maybe finding a good place to eat dinner. However, I was largely disappointed. When we first approached the gates to Chinatown, it looked promising. But beyond that, it's nothing but a bunch of rickety, cheap souvenir shops all selling the same mass produced stuff, or shops selling ""nicer"" items at an inflated price (i.e. things that don't say ""I Love San Francisco"" on them). We poked our head in to a couple of shops but didn't see anything that we wished to purchase. My husband found a store selling replica Samurai swords and knives, but it was basically the same items you can buy at the mall here for a lot less (they had a sword that was identical to one my husband already owns, which he paid $40.00 for at a comic convention in our hometown and they were wanting to charge $70.00 plus shipping).",2.0

I am sure there are many California architects who love nature and Golden Gate Park who could have created a better design.

You wonder who designed this place; Franz Kafka? Well, once you're past the dreadful exterior and the usual junk from contemporary darlings like Andy Goldsworthy, the inside is not at all bad and the art collection itself is pretty great. The temporary shows are more often excellent than not, as well. The museum cafe has superb (if pricey) food but is too noisy, though you can decamp to a tented outside annex which is much more relaxing. The sculpture gardens on either side are mixed nuts, but on a clear afternoon the views from the top of the Ugly Tower (access is, incredibly, free) are magnificent.

But then you have an African art gallery, a gallery of indigenous art and etc. When I was there, there was a fascinating exhibition of art from the Plack Panther era.

The entry is to a light filled atrium worth the visit. Follow the staff advice and start with the view from the top of the tower to the GG bridge, the city and park. Then visit some or all of the exhibitions. Cult of the Machine did not appeal to my wife but she came along and loved it. There was a collection of historic New Zealand paintings which would never be seen together elsewhere, a treat for us as New Zealanders. A collection of African American art including a number of quilts was a revelation of colour and movement with very limited found materials.

I was there today, walking in to the outside cafe area at the side of the museum and one of the guards told me I couldn't have my young daughter (2yrs) on my shoulders in case she fell off, they'd be liable. On a separate occasion we were in really early before almost anyone else was there and my daughter sat on the steps behind where the ticket desks are. A different guard told her I'd need to get her up as others could be coming down. Like I wouldn't have done that if there were others. Another occasion, yes another one, a member of staff barked at my two year old for being about a meter from one of the guard rails around a picture, even though I had my arms around her waist. Utterly bizarre over reactions on each occasion. Totally unwelcoming, really old fashioned. Most of the really good world class museums and galleries realized a few decades ago that democratizing access, creating a welcoming environment, not being rude to guests who are t doing anything remotely wrong, is actually not only good for business but is good for arts in the society.

de Young Museum,Alan H,Toronto,Canada17,7,Important museum in transition,Jan,2015,"The de Young is paired with the Legion of Honor as one of the two ""Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco"" (FAMSF). The Legion of Honor specializes in European art from the middle ages to the 20th century, while the de Young displays Native American, African, Oceanic, and settler American art. A bit of scandal erupted in 2012 after the flamboyant, populist director of FAMSF died. In the uncomfortable transition, several staff members were fired or left. A March 15, 2013, article in the NY Times spoke of ""turmoil"" at FAMSF, centered on the controversial chair of the trustees, a wealthy philanthropist. Since then a more scholarly director has been appointed who has been building up the collection and trying to restore the prestige of the museums. My sense after my recent visit to both museums is that, despite having a common director, they have very different approaches and cultures. At the Legion of Honor, the art on display is taken from the whole breadth of culture -- not just paintings but also furniture, tapestries, religious objects, jewelry, tea sets, books, wall decorations, clothing, etc. Art at the Legion of Honor is interpreted in a pretty traditional way in terms of form, technique, and meaning. The de Young, by contrast, doesn't seem to have so much patience for this traditional approach to the European canon. It tries to expand horizons with African, Native American, and Oceanic objects, which, however, too often seemed to be presented as anthropological artifacts, abstracted from their lived context, and reflecting ostensibly primitive symbol systems that little placards tried to explain. (But there's also more recent art by Native Americans which isn't distanced in this way.) With the settler art, the permanent exhibitions at the de Young focused on elite museum art, and were pretty light on more popular forms (commercial art, comic books, photography, religious art, illustrations for children's books, editorial cartoons, magazine covers, popular film, computer graphics, etc.). The posted interpretations seemed to have been written by an opinionated post-modern intellectual keen to alert visitors to contested identities, reinterpreted narratives, and the limitations of traditional media. I went away feeling that both museums needed a bit of shaking up. I thought they worked too hard at trying to get visitors to see things as curators see things, and not hard enough at helping visitors connect with the artists' creative spirit.",4.0

At de Young, the distinction blurs. Is a brilliantly decorated bowl used to serve food 2,000 years ago art or craft? “de Young” part of this museum contains Chihuly art-glass bowls and patters.

Audio program was nice balance of general useful info, and specifics about certain items with special features of note. After reading the reviews of people who gave low ratings, I believe their rating is inversely proportional to the size of the crowd and popularity of the visit seen. It is difficult to view any exhibit anywhere when there are too many people in the room. A popular museum in a popular park in a popular city is likely to draw a crowd. Go early on a weekday.

Both times, I had a small backpack with me. Many women had purses which were much larger. I was singled out by loud attendants both times dictating that my backpack must be held in my hand at all times. This is absurd. Not only is it an inconsistent policy (women wearing purses are not subjected to this loudly announced dictate), but I am never close to any artwork. The logic is that the backpack might fly off my shoulder and push the art work. Holding such items makes them much more heavy. Putting them on the floor means bending over to pick them consistently. For those who have disabilities or various pain, the practice is not conducive. We don't drive to the museum with the parking issues. Therefore, the policy is simply problematic.

Additionally, it was over-crowded, and, the essentially forced-bunching of people together for the “dazzling presentations/immersive experiences” only made the crowding issue worse (and this is not in terms of Covid/pre-Covid but simply in terms of layout and crowding when trying to view museum displays). And finally, the over-hyping within the presentations was disappointing if for no other reason then it demonstrated the curatorial inability to present the actual subject material which focused on a ruler who in reality was the equal of Trump in self-promotion – the “silly” presentation overshadowed the actual subject matter.",2.0
de Young Museum,JJJC_Family,None,None,Virginia636,"Much better than I anticipated and a great Ramses exhibit, to boot",Dec,2022,"Actually, we saw the Ramses exhibit along with the rest of the museum and we were pleasantly surprised by both. The exhibit was great. We have seen quite a few Egyptian exhibits plus the regular collections at many museums, including the one at the University of Pennsylvania, a personal favorite for sentimental reasons. I went there. Some bias showing. Although the dedicated Turin museum in Italy is hands-down the best I have seen by a long shot. I had read reviews and heard its praises, but the real kicker is the absolute passion of Italians who have seen it, particularly citizens of the city. There is mind boggling pride that they have what is regarded as the second best Egyptian museum in the world after the one in Cairo. In fact, if I could remember half of what I have seen and read in the museums, let alone Imax movies, TV shows, articles, etc. I could be an amateur Egyptian historian. Alas, I cannot remember 1/50th. What I can say is that like the Romans, the more you learn about this remarkable civilization, the more impressed you are. Considering they pre-date the Romans by almost two millenia and lasted even longer than the Romans ( although if you include the Byzantine empire, not by much), you have to say that they are the most impressive civilization in the history of man ( the Chinese may contest that ). Getting back to the exhibit, they had some really great pieces and it was interestingly assembled and presented. We spent a lot more time than I ever anticipated we would. Indeed, I liked it so much, I took a quick run through to see it getting back to the start and coming back to the end, where my wife patiently waited. Heck, she needed the rest, anyway. For me, I thought the rest of the museum was a throwaway. I did not think they would have much of a collection and would never have considered seeing it without the Ramses exhibit. This is perhaps our fifth visit to SF and I never gave it a second thought before, including this time until I saw an ad or something about the exhibit and I said to my wife, “Let’s go.” Good thing. The museum itself is great. The collections are of a high caliber and interesting. Again, we spent far more time on that than I ever imagined and I could have spent more. A special shout-out to the restaurant has to be made. This is a particularly good example of the genre. Light and airy, with pleasant views of the outside almost park-like setting and the food was very, very good. My wife and I had very good beef short ribs with vegetables and two excellent desserts and drinks. I didn’t even mind the exorbitant $85 tab. Our taxi cab driver coming home said that for SF that was a tremendous bargain. Speaking of taxis, the ride from our hotel, the very good Hotel Zoe Fishermans Wharf, was like $35 with tip. Between the two taxi rides, tickets to the museum, lunch and various stuff purchased in the gift shop, it was a very expensive museum outing, probably the most expensive we have had. If you add on the jaunt through the Japanese garden with the obligatory magnet purchase and the ride on the ferris wheel and the even more obligatory $8 dipped cone purchase from a truck parked nearby, it was one of the more expensive days in our extensive travels. And even though I am frugal by nature, I didn’t mind. It was one of the most satisfying and fullest days of the trip. Perhaps the best. In conclusion, go to the de Young Museum and go now before the Ramses exhibit closes. It would be a shame to miss it.",5.0

Ghirardelli Square,Misuzu00,Bowie,MD5,3,"Warning: this is a high-crime area, as we learned.",Aug,2015,"We visited Ghirardelli Square during our last couple hours in SF to take our kids to get ice cream. It was mid-morning and there were tons of people around. Unfortunately, when we returned to our rental car an hour later, we found the windows smashed out and all our children's backpacks stolen. We were stunned-- this is a major tourist area, and we were parked on a busy street on a corner with a security camera pointed directly at our parking space. But what we learned when we called the police, and from the many, many locals who stopped to talk to us as we cleaned up the glass, is that this is a very common occurrence there. There are actually small signs taped on the parking meters that warn that ""this area is a target for break-ins"" (we missed that). I know-- stupid tourists, didn't realize thieves would smash out windows in front of witnesses on a busy corner at 11:30 AM to steal children's toys. The police would only take a report over the phone and wouldn't come out or even review the security camera footage. Fortunately, a good Samaritan on a bike helped us look around and he found our abandoned bags five blocks away, with my 9-year-old son's iPad, some money, and a camera missing. It was DEFINITELY not worth it just to go to the flagship Ghirardelli ice cream parlor, where they serve you ice cream in plastic cups and you have to fetch your own water. I realize this review may not go over well with some people, but you can see this is not what I normally post on this site and I want to warn other tourists that Ghirardelli Square is a target for thieves (as evidenced by the signs on the meters, not just my anecdotal experience), is not attended to by police (as many locals informed us), and is not an area where ANYONE should be parking with out-of-state tags or rental car identifiers. I am attaching a photo of my happy children standing by our parking space at the Ghirardelli building after our bags were recovered by the good Samaritan. The only child not smiling is my 9-year-old whose iPad was stolen from his backpack with a stuffed monkey pillow attached to it. Great last experience in San Francisco.

The nude area is at the North end and starts roughly where the sand ladder is but there are no signs – if you see lots of nude people you are in the nudist area :-) It is very popular with locals but is also easy to get to even for tourists (1 hour - bus + short walk from San Fran Financial district). The “back drop” is a fantastic view of the Golden Gate Bridge and is very popular with sight seers coming to take photos (of the Bridge not the nudists); a lot are clearly shocked/uncomfortable when they realise that this tourist attraction is full of nude people but they have no option but to ignore them. The beach is sandy with either dunes behind or cliff at the very Northern end; the majority of the Beach to the South is the textile area and gets very busy, this is where the parking and toilets are. I have only been on week days and the crowd was mainly male retired but there were some females and some in their twentys. For me it is the amazing scenery, both natural and man made, combined with the ease of access as a tourist (don’t need a hire car) that make this a great nudist beach.",5.0

Additionally, please note that there is a strong smell of smoke from those enjoying the beach around you. Regardless, it is a nice beach, with great views. Parking is limited, so you may consider taking an Uber to get there. Also, please note that the restroom/porta pottys are nasty to the point of unusable.

However, closer to the bridge, and a little more difficult to access is Marshall Beach, which has even a better view, fewer tourists and more true nudists. About a mile walk over steeper terrain, from either Baker Beach, or from the bridge.

At times there were so many nude people that they stretched all the way until the parking. Over half were men but unlike what I read before I came there, there were many women of all ages. In some groups of friends there were more women. Most people were enjoying the sun. Some were trying to swim, some strolled along the ocean, some played volleyball. The atmosphere was friendly. I was pleasantly surprised by how easily people start a conversation. I had an impression that some clothed people were curious about nudity because they walked up and sat among us and chatted with us and played volleyball. I did not see any erections, sexuality, gawking and next time I fly in that direction I'll make sure my wife comes along.",5.0
