Alcatraz Island,Frankie Painter,194,Feb 2023,Absolutely loved my day here! I bought a ticket online although I could have easily saved the $8 processing fee and bought it at the gate. I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs because I was there in the off season  (mid-Jan). I signed up for an 11am slot but ‚Ä¶,
Alcatraz Island,Devin Ganka,177,May 2022,"Love the history!! The audio tour was actually really good and informative. From the moment you step on the island you can feel the history.

Alcatraz Island,David Garnica,236,Jun 2022,"Great historical place. The rangers are very knowledgeable about everything the rock was about and the audio tour really brings the place to life.

Alcatraz Island,Katherine,137,May 2022,"Loved this experience and the audio. It is very windy, cold, and the mist from the ocean can get you wet. So best way to go is probably a wind breaker.

Alcatraz Island,Chelsea Jane,10,Mar 2023,Enjoyed the tour and loved the experience. Not too expensive. The boat ride wasn't bad or long at all. You could even buy snacks and hot chocolate on the boat! Wasn't too busy on the weekday tour but still a lot of people! The prison and self guided tour was cool. Even the island outside was cool.

It makes you consider the families that lived on the island alongside the prisoners.,
Alcatraz Island,Suddha Sircar,41,Oct 2022,We had booked the evening tour to the Alcatraz island.

Alcatraz Island,Michael Marth,440,Oct 2022,First time visiting Alcatraz and couldn‚Äôt have asked for better weather as it was gorgeous.
