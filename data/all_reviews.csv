TripAdvisor,Alcatraz Island,My family took the tour ( BUY TICKETS IN ADVANCE)! We have 2 small boys and an infant. It wasn't difficult at all to maneuver with our stroller and we made the trek with all children. The ferry is clean and peaceful with snack for purchase ( we purchased 4 hotdogs and drinks in advance). The boat bathroom is clean and appropriate for all needs. The island also has clean and appropriate facilities. There are steep hills but we are an active family so we didn't struggle with this. The audio tour was appropriate for all children and we enjoyed it as well. This was not only educational but also a lifelong memory made with our family! 110% recommend!,5.0,"Mar, 2023",
TripAdvisor,Alcatraz Island,This is a must stop if you are in San Fran!!! We did the audio tour and was very interesting!!! We were going to do ther night tour but didnt book far enough in advance!! Should book night tour a week in advance.,5.0,"Feb, 2023",
TripAdvisor,Alcatraz Island,I did not expect to enjoy the tour as much as I did. The recorded tour was very informational and done very well. I often do not listen to these type of tours as they are boring but this one held my attention. Definitely recommend this tour.,5.0,"Mar, 2023",
TripAdvisor,Alcatraz Island,San Francisco is completely unsafe. We bought tickets for Alcatraz. We drove around trying to find parking. Found a place. Gangs were patrolling the area. Windows were smashed out of cars. We were right in front of pier 33. We couldn’t even go on the tour because the thought of getting our window smashed and everything inside taken. I asked around. This is a common occurrence. No police anywhere. Mind you this is middle of daylight hours. Unbelievable that the city has been destroyed by crime. I would never return. I didn’t get a refund for our tickets.,1.0,"Mar, 2023",
TripAdvisor,Alcatraz Island,"I had a 13-hour layover in San Francisco And I wanted to do something with a lot of fresh air to keep me awake after a no-sleep flight from Asia. The Alcatraz tour filled that bill nicely. I was originally going to take a guided tour that cost $150, but they were all booked up. Glad I did not. This tour was a third the price. Given the excellent audio guide, the Park Rangers, and enthusiastic docents, there was no reason to pay for an additional guide. $50 is still kind of expensive, especially if you have children, but it does include the boat ride which was lovely.",4.0,"Mar, 2023",

TripAdvisor,Alcatraz Island,My friends and I did the day-time tour of the island and it was FANTASTIC. There is so much history I wasn't aware of - you learn a lot. You can do as much guided/unguided as you want. I also didn't realize how beautiful the island is - the grounds are very well kept and the gardens are stunning. It's a GREAT spot for birdwatching - I had 3 lifers while on the island!,5.0,"Nov, 2022",

TripAdvisor,Alcatraz Island,"$50 is a little pricey for the self guided tour. You pay for the ferry ride and the recorded tour, but worth maybe $30 not &50. The room talking about change within our prison systems, I hope my booking supports some of that!

TripAdvisor,Alcatraz Island,"What a fun experience! Took the 10:15 Ferry from Pier 33. Ferry was well equipped with snacks, beverages, and restrooms. Ride was 15-20 minutes. Spectacular views of the island can be captures on the way. When disembarking, there is a Park Ranger giving short instructions then you are off to climb to the top of the rock! Pick up your audio tour and enjoy the history and fascination of this historical place. We learned a lot and thoroughly enjoyed walking all over the grounds. We were lucky to take in a FREE guided tour that allowed entry into areas otherwise blocked off. From the lighthouse, the San Francisco Cityscape is amazing. You can also take in both Golden Gate and Bay bridges. Don't miss seeing the lovely gardens and landscaping as well as the numerous species of nesting birds. The gift shop is reasonably priced and has pretty much any souvenir you might want. While the buildings may be old and hold many not so positive stories, Alcatraz Island is beautiful. Recommend planning to make this your only stop for the day, as to see and enjoy, you need 4-5 hours to take it all in. Can be done in a shorter amount of time but why rush. Note - only bottles of water are allowed on the island and large backpacks are not permitted. Cost was very well worth the price!",5.0,"Feb, 2023",
TripAdvisor,Alcatraz Island,Booked on the 9.45 ferry but arrived earlier than expected which turned out perfect timing as we were allowed to board the first ferry of the morning - which was nice and quiet.

However, I found that everything was REALLY well done. The tour noted the hardships of being in jail without glorifying them and there was even an exhibit about how incarnation effects modern society. Definitely give yourself the time to walk around and explore the whole island as there were details and additional information that I would have missed if I just did the tour and then hopped back on the ferry.",5.0,"Jan, 2023",

TripAdvisor,Alcatraz Island,"My friends and I took the first ferry of the morning to reach Alcatraz Island and it was worth it. We cruised through the legendary SF fog to reach the island and when we arrived we were greeted with the remnants of the Indigenous people's occupation of the island. I am glad that the NPS did not try to brush over this part of the history of the island and people of the country. The island is sizable and accessible by foot. Make sure to pack warm clothes because it is quite cool and windy there. The prison itself has a guided audio tour with various stop points throughout the building to get a sense of the history of the people and location. Additionally, there was a fascinating exhibit about the occupation in an industrial building on the north side of the island. I learned a lot about the occupation through the images and words shared by the people who were there. Alcatraz is easily a half-day experience. Make sure to book your tickets ahead of time in order to have the experience you want. It is definitely a visit you should make if you're in the bay area.",5.0,"Jul, 2022",

TripAdvisor,Alcatraz Island,"A visitação é bem interessante, mas meu alerta fica por conta da cidade. São Francisco acabou, lamentavelmente ! Estacionei num “public parking” no Pier 33 por U$ 35. Havia placas orientando não deixar pertences no carro, com fotos de vidros de carros quebrados. Um verdadeiro atestado de incompetência da gestão pública ! Achei que não seria possível que acontecesse, num estacionamento pago, às 9 horas da manhã. Pois bem, quando retornei ao meio-dia, vários carros estavam com seus vidros quebrados, inclusive o meu ! Levaram mala e mochila, com muitos pertences. Pra piorar, a polícia disse que, sem nenhuma violência física, nada faria, e que eu deveria fazer um registro online.

TripAdvisor,Alcatraz Island,"Being in S. F. on the off-season. No lines, hardly anyone out-n-about. So basically anywhere we went, we didn't encounter wall-to-wall folks or lines. It was fabulous. Shops, restaurants, walking, biking were all easily managed without bumping into lots of folks. Luv'd it. Only line we stood in was prior to boarding the ferry to Alcatraz which was understandable. However, that said, the line went quickly. And bc it was not full to capacity, we were able to board the earlier scheduled departure time. Our departure time was 1:40p, but we actually boarded w the 12:30p grp. That was a plus in itself. Ferry ride was comfortable. They have snacks & restrooms on board. It was about a 15 min actual ride once we were all on board. Plenty of seating. Alcatraz itself was amazing. A lot of history there. The staff were top notch! Very professional and informative. Be sure to dress in layers and wear yr comfortable walking shoes. A lot of up and down walking. It was a wonderful experience over all from start to finish. Would absolutely recommend visiting. Be sure to go online well in advance of yr trip to secure yr tickets. Even though our dates were off-season, the tickets were being snatched up. I did find out how easy it was to cancel and change our dates slightly as we were initially concerned about all the rain, flooding, etc on the news days before. But i kept in constant contact directly w the hotel. Also, there is no need to print out the tickets as long as u receive the QR code on yr phone. Then prior to boarding, u can just show yr QR code on your phone and u r good to go. It all worked out in the end.",5.0,"Jan, 2023",

TripAdvisor,Alcatraz Island,Book your tickets in advance so that you avoid disappointment. The tours to Alcatraz are indeed very popular and rightly so. Book through the official site of Alcatraz. It is much cheaper. The Forrest Rangers and volunteers do the guided tours on the island and provide useful information. Buy the self guided audio. The narrative pace is excellent. Allows you to see everything at an easy pace. Reaching the prison from the dock is uphill and can be a little strenuous but there is a small electric cart that gives a free ride to the top for those who need it.,5.0,"Dec, 2022",
TripAdvisor,Alcatraz Island,"I have been to Alcatraz before and enjoyed my visits, but have always wanted so see more. This time I planned more carefully than usual, and booked the behind the scenes tour. I am very glad I did. First, it’s a small group (20-30) and you have an outbound ferry all to yourselves. The ranger led tour begins as soon as you get on the island, and included access to the industry building, hospital, chapel, gun galleries and dungeons - areas I have not been able to see before. You take the usual audio tour of the cell house, but after most of the crowds have dissipated (just with the night tour folks). After that, you can stay on for the night tour ranger led activities, which bring you back to the dock ready for the 6.40 or 7.40 pm return ferries. Definitely worth springing for behind the scenes tour tickets if you can get them.",5.0,"Dec, 2022",

TripAdvisor,Alcatraz Island,"My sister and I had booked a ""BEHIND THE SCENES TOUR"" through Viator. Upon arrival at Alcatraz, we had a group of about 15 people. We were directed to National Park Service docents, three in all. What we didn't realize was that upon arrival at Alcatraz, you can just wander around by yourself. The primary docent had started with a story about Native Americans taking over the Island in the later 1960's...way too much detail on this topic. The group started up the hill towards the water tank and morgue and this docent starts up again with the minutae regarding the Native Americans taking over the Island in the later 1960's....on and on and on. BORING. My sister and I made our way AWAY from the group, did a self-conducted tour, returned to Sausalito on an earlier ferry and had a wonderful meal at The Spinnaker. The moral of the this story...the so-called ""behind the scenes tour"" was going to take several hours. If you're OK with walking around by yourself, you will be fine.",3.0,"Nov, 2022",

I have to think it’s caused by all the bird poop, which is sizable. The island should be cleaned up a little to make the experience a little better. Considering the amount of people travel through this site each day (and it must be a couple thousand), one would think they could afford to remove the collapsed buildings and keep the place a bit cleaner (power wash) which may reduce the smell and the flies.

The rangers even gave a really interesting chat with some facts before the self guided tour began. There’s a really extensive gift shop with a lot of cool things. It’s a can’t miss in SF (especially for history lovers). My only tip is to grab one of the audio tours they offer instead of trying to do it from your phone. It was very “position sensitive” so you easily missed it if you held it in the wrong position…it would also turn off if you moved it slightly. Definitely didn’t work well for 2 people.

No real need to get to the pier massively early before your slot = the boats are big. Wear layers, even on a sunny August, the boat journey & the island itself is very windy. Brilliant place to visit. Worked out around $45 each, which was good value for money. Follow the audio guide & make sure to pause to allow time to fully experience some areas (like the exercise yard).

TripAdvisor,Alcatraz Island,"We booked ahead for Alcatraz and went on a busy Monday in August. When we got to the queue we were surprised that they required masks to be worn in the queue, on the boat and on the island. During a 2 week holiday in the States we hadn’t had to wear them anywhere else! As we hadn’t needed them, we left them in the hotel so we then had to purchase them for $2.25 each! The tour is well organised, you’re only allowed to queue for the boat when it’s your time, then they load and leave quite quickly. On the island there is a quick talk by one of the Rangers then you head up the hill to collect your Audio Tour (by this time a lot of people had removed their masks). I did the tour years ago and you were given headphones which were good because they blocked out all other noises, now you get a handset the size of a remote control, which is in a bag, then you hold it to your ear. The tour is still really good but I’m pretty sure it used to be much longer and because you can’t pause the Audio Tour is seems very rushed. When we’d given back the handset we then walked back to the places we wanted to revisit. It’s a good tour and Alcatraz is still an amazing place to visit. The mask policy is a bit of a joke though!",4.0,"Aug, 2022",

TripAdvisor,Alcatraz Island,"My husband and I enjoyed our visit to Alcatraz. The boat trip went smoothly and it was a strange, foreboding feeling to get closer to the island on the approach. The greeting from the ranger was informative as we were told about one of the prisoner’s attempted escapes (10 years in the making!) It was a bit steep walking up to the cellhouse for the tour of the main prison, but worth it. The audio guide was a great way to learn about Alcatraz history and some of the anecdotes from previous guards and inmates. There were lots of other visitors so it did feel quite crowded at times. Although having to wear a mask was a little irritating, it made sense with the amount of people present. Variety of items to purchase in the gift shop and friendly staff around the island. Our experience was impacted somewhat by the flies which were constantly swarming around (apparently it was the time of year for them so bear this in mind).

Felt like we did not see as much as in the past, even with the extra add on tour, the tour felt like it was all about the guides dramatic performance, not actually seeing the island!

TripAdvisor,Golden Gate Bridge,"Having watched countless movies over the years that portray this iconic bridge, it was an amazing feeling to drive across it. We wanted to a view from both the north and south side of the bridge. Coming from the north, required that we drive across, from north to south. Following the GPS directions is not easy for a 1st timer and I had to retrace my steps to access the tunnel that leads to the south view point. Take note that as far as I undertand the north and south lookouts are only accessible by crossing the bridge and then merging of the main bridge. I won't explain the directions because I personally was quite confused. Welcome to San Fransisco! We got a good view from the north view point, but at the south view point, fog rolled in and not much could be seen. I was most amazed at how thick and fast the fog can roll in. The ambince in the shrouded fog is a combination of AWE and EERIE. The south view point has a nice souvenir shop. Parking is equally challenging at both points.

TripAdvisor,Golden Gate Bridge,"Estive agora no começo de julho até o meio de julho em San Francisco. Visitei a Golden Gate em dois dias distintos, em ambos tinha muito sol. A diferença é que no primeiro dia foi num domingo por volta das 11:30 da manhã e no outro dia era uma sexta-feira por volta das 16:00. Da primeira vez que estive lá estava com muita neblina só em volta da ponte e simplesmente não dava para ver nada dela e o gozado que a neblina ficava só na ponte, no entorno estava um sol de rachar. No segundo dia que fui lá, praticamente não tinha neblina e consegui fazer vídeos e fotos tranquilamente. Em ambos os dias estacionei num estacionamento que fica em Presidio, para chegar nele, vindo pela Freeway US-101 North sair na saída 439 que fica próximo da Golde Gate, e depois disso sempre se manter a direita, vai pegar uma subida, passar por baixo da freeway, chegar num cruzamento com uma rua que é a rua que você provavelmente vai usar pra ir embora depois, e mais uns 300 metros para a frente tem uma entrada para um estacionamento gratuito que pelo menos quando fui tinha bastante vaga disponível, o problema naquele estacionamento é que há muitos casos de furtos relatados, é indicado deixar absolutamente nada dentro do carro a vista, ele chama Langdon Court Parking na Lincoln Boulevard, esse estacionamento dá pra ver pelo google Maps. E se colocar ele no Waze dá pra achar facilmente. Lá venta muito, e faz frio mesmo durante o verão e com sol de rachar, então indico levar ao menos um agasalho.",5.0,"Jul, 2022",

I returned my rental car when I arrived in San Francisco and used the Muni system for the weekend I visited. The app shows all the stops so you can plan out your day. We did the all day ticket instead of the $8 one and was glad we did. A family sitting in front of us were told their tickets expired, and he agued that he had bought them before standing in line. He wound up having to repurchase them, so I assume if you buy them at the booth they must have an expiration of a few hours. It’s also cheaper to buy a day ticket then 2 single rides. And you can use the trans and buses too, I used the tram to return from the Ferry Marketplace to the Wharf when my feet started to get tired. There are helpful employees at the cable car area too wearing orange jackets to help you with any questions. It seems like they are working hard to get tourists back and are there help them when needed. The only bad part was the wait to return back to union square was long, over an hour.

Yeah. But, not us. Always courteous staff, and the $8.00 fare was worth it. So, do your research, see how close the Cable Car runs to your hotel in you're visiting, and enjoy. We sure did.

TripAdvisor,Cable Cars,"Fui no dia 10 de Julho, um domingo para San Francisco passear, e estacionei num parking no subsolo da Union Square, bem próximo à parada do Cable car na Powell Street com a Geary Street, peguei uma fila que esperei uma hora aproximadamente embaixo de sol de 30 graus sem cobertura para conseguir subir no bondinho e não consegui ir pendurado, tive que ir dentro do bonde em pé, porque o condutor não deixa a gente ficar lá atrás muito tempo, já que tem um condutor lá que fica manuseando uma manivela em vários momentos da viagem. Vale a pena comprar o passport para 1 dia pelo app MuniMobile, para mim custou 13 dólares. Isso porque se você pretende parar em Lombard Street por exemplo e depois continuar a usar o bonde terá que pagar outra passagem e cada passagem individual são 7 dólares e com o passport você consegue usar qualquer uma das opções de transporte público em San Francisco por um dia quantas vezes quiser. Esse bonde que passa pela Powell St vs Geary St é o Powell and Hyde St, o Cable car tem um total de 3 linhas, sendo duas muito parecidas que tem o mesmo ponto final, sendo elas essa primeira que citei e a Powell and Mason St, e tem uma terceira que te leva para o centro financeiro aonde ficam os prédios altos de San Francisco. No turnaround em Fisherman's Wharf da linha Powell st and Hyde st eu fiquei numa fila também embaixo do sol por aproximadamente 1:30 minutos, a viagem entre o começo da linha e o final da linha é rápido e você pode pedir para parar em qualquer uma",5.0,"Jul, 2022",

Most noticeably the cost of food - whether this was because of the area being a 'tourist spot' not sure but for two people a basic evening meal (including a soft-drink) was averaging at $65 whilst breakfast was on average $40. We visited 3 or 4 eateries on Pier 39 and none of these were particularly good food (in fact, the best meal we had was in the main city at a shopping centre - would you believe it!).

TripAdvisor,Lombard Street,"One of my favorite destinations in San Francisco. Prior to Today ( Friday, 11/19/21), I always walked down 30+ times from the side walks. Going down on the right and come back up on the right. Lombard St & Garden is a 1 way 8 hairpin turns from Hyde going down to Leavenworth. Today I manage to walk down to famous Lombard St, but do be carful. There are cars, van, SUV and yellow GO car coming down. At each hairpin turn, you can turn out to the sidewalk. During week day, it’s not as busy. The view you get on the side, is the Coit Tower, majestically sits in the other side. Lombard is located on Russian hills. During Gold Rush, there is a small cemetery near the top buried Russians.",5.0,"Nov, 2021",

What makes it crazier is that flowers line the street, and crowds of people are walking up and down while you are driving. At the bottom, the previous driver or passengers pop out of their car for some quick snapshots up the street, but because of the flowers obscuring the contours of the street it just looks like a field of flowers in the middle of a street. Suffice to say this is an experience you need to just DO. No video or photo will do it justice. Beware of the lines as well.

My family and I were visiting the Bay Area for a water polo tournament so we decided on a whim to see if we could get tickets and catch a Giants game.

Although this is the kind of stadium where every seat has a fantastic view and feel like part of the game. Food is above average for a ballpark, we had the bacon wrapped hotdogs with sautéed onions, garlic fries, Thai iced tea with boba, Lumpia and Limeade. Everything was delicious. Expensive but yummy. The park adjacent to the bay is pretty gorgeous. Although jacket chilly even in the middle of July. Parking was a breeze using SpotHero, $35 to park in Lot A which is a short 2.5 block walk to the O’Doul gate. Parking spots are tight but doable. We left a little early so missed the mass exodus.

TripAdvisor,Oracle Park,"I didn't take a tour of the ballpark, but I did go to a game. I was rooting for the away team (Go Cards!) and the fans were nothing but friendly. The ballpark offers a wide variety of food and drink options and I wanted to try a lot more than I had room for! It was really neat to walk out around right field and look out into McCovey Cove. I've seen it on TV growing up (mostly in the playoffs...when the Giants were beating the Cards), so it was cool to see in person. Even if you're going in the middle of summer, be sure to bundle up. When the sun goes down and the wind starts blowing in off the bay, it gets coldddd. I was there 4th of July weekend and had on a long sleeved shirt, a hoodie, and a windbreaker and I was still cold.",4.0,"Jul, 2019",

TripAdvisor,Oracle Park,"If you can get past of all the name changes (originally Pac Bell Park, then SBC Park, then AT&T Park and now most recently Oracle Park) in the past 20 years then you have a better memory than I do. Regardless, my family and I have been to many baseball parks across the U.S. and do find Oracle Park one of the best. There are so many different areas to sit with the Club Level being our favorite. They have a ton of food choices and abundant restrooms that are never terribly crowded or dirty. The views are very nice throughout the park and is fun to do a lap around the park and visit the stadium before the game starts. The park opens 2 hours before game time and there are always lots of give-aways throughout the season. Now if we could get a team that can win again, we'll be all set. Have fun at our park!",5.0,"Dec, 2019",
TripAdvisor,Oracle Park,"Last month I went on my first tour of a baseball park at Minute Maid Park (Houston Astros). Usually I prefer to go to games, but since I was in the area why not. The one in Houston left a lot to be desired with the tour guide being really arrogant so I wasn't sure if I'd want to go on another. I decided to give Oracle Park a shot since I was in San Francisco and it's so pretty on tv. Russ was amazing. He was the exact kind of person you would want to represent your team to fans from all different teams.. There were fans of the Giants (obviously), Cubs (me.. :) ), White Sox, Twins, Cardinals, Royals, etc and he managed to recognize that and treat everyone for what they were... baseball fans. You could tell he was proud of the team he has been cheering for since he was 8, but he didn't put down everyone else to make his points.

TripAdvisor,Oracle Park,I was in San Francisco for business and as a baseball fan I had to catch a game a Oracle Park. I arrived 2 hours early and was able to park in Lot A of third street for $40.00. Waling up to the stadium and checking out the statues near McCovey cove is pretty awesome. One thing to know going in is there is only 4 gates to enter the park. When 35k people are going into the game that is not many and the lines are long. They do have a special line for club seat ticket holders and if you have a Clear account you can get in quicker. Eat first!!! The lines get really long during the game and you could easily miss a inning or two waiting in line Compared to other parks the one thing that stood out to me is how tight the concourse is. If you are a baseball fan its a must check out but plan on arriving early and if you don't care who wins you might want to check out around the eight inning.,4.0,"Sep, 2019",

It's just too far with small children. Had I known, I would have called for a ride share. To get there we took a pedi ride. She said it was 25$ and then changed it to $40 as we were already en route. What a crock. Take a rideshare from the wharf, but the traffic is terrible starting about an hour before the game. If you want to take a electric streetcar, get on where it starts by the In and Out burger near the end of the wharf or it will be packed and unable to pick you up at any other stop along the way.

We knew we were going to have some free time on our last day in SF, so we luckily were able to book a tour on-line the night before. We (fortunately) arrived early (our Uber driver dropped us off at the corner of King and 2nd) and we were able to leisurely walk along King Street and read all the name plaques along the stadium wall but if you're pressed for time, have your driver drop you off near the Willie Mays Statue on the corner of King and 3rd. You'll need to pick up your tickets at the Giants Dugout Store further down 3rd St. The tour was fun and informative, especially for my 13 y.o. son. Granted, he LOVES baseball but I think this tour would be enjoyable for anyone who appreciates sports. We got to see the visitors clubhouse, the inside batting cages, dugout, skyboxes and more. We even got to venture out onto the field for some really great pictures.

TripAdvisor,Oracle Park,"We had seats on the top deck and even there the view was amazing. You could see all the action very clearly. Yes, the players were far away (no autographs or stray balls). Only negatives were the high prices for concessions ( $9 for a large soft drink!) and the swarm of seagulls around the 9th inning. They must be conditioned to show up AFTER a game usually ends. They were looking for food scraps and it wasn't just a few birds ... it was 70-100 gulls who didn't care who they bombed with their excrement.

TripAdvisor,Fisherman's Wharf,"After many recommendations we added a 2.5 day stop in the city, Fisherman’s Wharf area, as part of our US road trip. We visited from the UK. Overall the city was a disappointment. On our first evening in Fisherman’s we witnessed a car pull up alongside a stationary vehicle, a guy jump out, smashed the windows, stole some bags and sped off. Passersby didn’t bat an eyelid. The following day we witnessed multiple shop lifting. The staff were aware but didn’t act. Clearly this is par for the course in SF. The city has a massive homeless problem and many are drugged up statues or crazily shouting at people in the street. We watched one homeless guy drag his duvet over tourists food as they sat outside a restaurant. The city is pretty dirty, litter everywhere but it is windy in fairness.

Then next day on our way back from an Alcatraz tour we stopped in to eat at the Wipe Out for lunch, a great day to eat, people watch and shop. Most of the seals from the night before had since gone, so it probably depends on when you visit. My son who is 13 year old loved this place to just walk around and see the bay. Great views. We had a hotel within walking distance, so we did not have to worry about parking. The morning was very empty by lunch time many more people were out, but it never seemed crowded like NYC.

TripAdvisor,Fisherman's Wharf,"I am a frequent visitor, part time resident of San Francisco and should have known better! I wanted to purchase a new and better set of Binoculars and thought, since there were a number of stores along and near Fisherman's Wharf, it would be a competitive and good place to purchase them. WRONG!! I should have known better! My wife and I went into one of the yellow signed camera/electronics stores, this one the On Line Camera Gallery, Inc., and asked to see their binocular selection. We were shown several and told they would give us a special deal on a set of Bushnell Perma Focus. They represented that the usual retail price for this set was $499 but they would sell them to us at the same price that the couple just next to us at the counter had paid, $350. We accepted the price and made the purchase. They gave us a receipt and asked that we also sign the receipt, in addition to the credit card charge. I then went back to our condo and looked up the binoculars on the internet. It turns out that this set of binoculars retails for $106 and was available, including shipping, from Bushnell for $64.98. I was angry!! I went back to the store and asked for a refund. This was refused with the clerk showing me that the receipt he had us sign said ""no refund"". I then asked what he was going to do to make me happy since he had lied to us as to the correct retail price and we had overpaid by so much. He said he was not authorized to make any changes. After a heated exchange, I finally got him to throw in an added pair of binoculars, the Olympus Trooper 7X35. I gave up and accepted this. It turns out the price the Olympus sell for on the internet is $51.99, including shipping. So, for our $350 we received $116 in value for merchandise. We were ripped off! So, I caution any visitors to San Francisco when shopping for cameras, electronics or other items from those yellow signed shops. It is sad that stores take advantage of tourists, leaving a bad taste for San Francisco, even as this city offers so much to visitors. If you just have to buy something at Fisherman's Wharf, know that you are at a disadvantage as you can't rely that these shops are truthful and that they are waiting for unsuspecting individuals. My advice is, go to the center of town to the large shops for this type of purchase. Unfortunately, my wife and I were naive.",1.0,"Oct, 2012",

TripAdvisor,Fisherman's Wharf,"Fisherman's Warf was a fun very touristy thing to do with tons of souvenir shops which was fine. You can't really visit SF with out saying you've been here or Pier 39. Lots of wonderful restaurants around here and you can find some very good deals on souvenirs if you are looking to take something home. Also we found that many are willing to wheel and deal with you if you ask. My big warning to you is DO NOT PARK AT A PLACE CALLED PRIORITY PARKING. THEY ARE A COMPLETE SCAM! We drove our car in the lot at noon on a Saturday down there. Their were cars ahead of us so we were farther back in the lot away from their small booth. It was valet style so we all got out the guy took our keys and said we pay when we get back. After a very long day of walking and walking and walking around SF, Pier 39, Lombard Street, Fisherman's Warf etc. we took a cab back to our car/parking lot. It was 9:45 on a Saturday night.... They were CLOSED! A note was on our car to get our keys from another lot in another part of town!!! We had to take a cab over to that lot, pay, get our keys then take another cab back to our car which all took about an hour and a half and cost us another $30.00 in addition to the $35.00 it was to park there! Insane! What kind of parking place closes at 6:00, yep that's right 6:00 is when they closed on a Saturday, in a tourist town and the attendants never told us to be back by 6:00 because we close. I think because they know we would have said REALLY?!? well we have to park somewhere else then! It does say their hours in very small print up by the tiny booth but not on the other side which is what you see driving in, that has the prices to park in the lot which everyone sees. I believe if they had it in large print on the sign they know that know one would park there because who would be ready to leave this tourist area at 6:00 on a Saturday nigh? Sheesh we were just starting dinner at that time. They are a scam, they have their hours in small print for a reason and it cost us $65.00 just to park here and a lot of extra screwing around. We had two little kids with us and were pushing it at 9:45 as for their bed time but then we ended up not leaving the parking lot until 11:30 after all the wasted time going back and fourth in an expensive taxi. Then when we complained to the manager of Priority Parking that the attendants should be telling people that they close at 6:00, he replied with ""it is not my problem"".

TripAdvisor,Fisherman's Wharf,"I've lived in San Francisco since 1991 and will never for the life of me understand the unending attraction of Fisherman's Wharf. I'm not alone as no local I know ever spends time there except when visitors come to town and insist. It's a boring mall on the water. The only exception is to see the sea lions. Here's a real tip: walk west beyond Hyde Street toward the Aquatic Park. To me, everything west of Hyde Street along the Northern Waterfront is as good as SF gets & everything east of it is as bad as it gets. Hyde Street Pier with its historic ships is wonderful. My favorite accessible beach in SF is the Aquatic Park which has unbeatable views of the Golden Gate Bridge and as it is protected by a breakwater, the water is calmer and warmer than the bay in general. On hot days it's an invitation to wade or swim. Keep going over the hill to Fort Mason for more wonderful northern waterfront places like Fort Mason and Chrissy Field which are truly wonderful. I doubt this review will give anyone coming to San Francisco pause but honestly, you aren't experiencing the city at all at Fisherman's Wharf, just crap shacks full of t-shirts and restaurants where no one who lives here would ever think of dining.

TripAdvisor,Exploratorium,"Whether it's time tested favorite exhibits or new ones reflecting today's ever-evolving technologies, you can always count of the Exploratorium to make for a fantastic visit. It really is more than just your going science museum, it's also one of perception, art, and even nature. They were one of the first to offer so many interactive exhibits and lectures where you actually become part of the experience instead of just observing. We love their After Dark feature, also affectionately known as 'Date Night', every Thursday evening from 6-10pm. As to their newer exhibits, one of them, the ""Cells to Self"" is fascinating in its collaboration of science and the human body. But then again, that's just normal for the E, they're always looking for ways to challenge the mind and showcase the wonders of intelligence.",5.0,"Dec, 2019",

However, the Exploratorium was full of large group of noisy children. Several times when we were looking at a board or an instruments the children simply jumped in and took over and I had to tell them that we were actually looking or using the instrument. I have never in the world experienced anything like that. It was like as if they had not been brought up at all - had learned nothing about how to behave.. Even children not in groups but right next to their parents behaved like this .. and the parents didn't say anything. In the beginning we were laughing at this rude kind of behaviour, because it was so unexpected, but in the end we left the museum because it was so annoying. Also they were running around yelling. The museum is not to blame for the behaviour of the visitors, but they could consider to make some areas for people older than 12 years old or some areas suitable for smaller kids, so that everyone could have a nice experience. Also I truly doubt that these kids understand anything of what the museum is trying to teach them...",1.0,"Jul, 2017",

Between children who've never be taught to not scream and shout in public places, school groups that think the place is a play ground, teens running and playing tag and youngsters of all ages bumping into you and/or butting in while you are looking at an exhibit you will wish you had picked a better time.

TripAdvisor,Exploratorium,"Okay, so we weren't too keen on visiting a 'museum' in San Francisco. I mean we grew up near the Science and Industry museum in Chicago and I've been to the Franklin Institute in Philly like way too many times. Our SF relatives suggested this place, and we initially said, no, not interested. But then when we were on a tour to Muir Woods, our guide looked at us like we had 3 heads when we said we weren't interested in going to a science museum. He's like oh, you HAVE to go there, (and we had 3 kids with us ages 7, 10, and 14). We were more into seeing the redwoods and Alcatraz and SF history, but we reconsidered squeezing this in. SO GLAD we did!!! Our 80 year old relative enjoyed it as much as we and our kids did. This is basically more of a hands on experiment museum. Truly fascinating in so many areas of science. We spent about 2+ hours here but we considered going back a day later because we only saw a little more than half. We just didn't have time to go back. It's really really cool, and our middle schooler got LOTS of science project ideas that we had never even thought of (and my husband and I have doctorates in the science fields), so yeah, it's totally fun even for the professionals!

TripAdvisor,Exploratorium,"On a recent trip to San Francisco, we decided to go to the Exploratorium - the descriptions we read made it sound great. Unfortunately it wasn't. It cost $88 for four of us and that didn't even cover the tactile dome. It was essentially an indoor playground where parents let their little kids run around from one station to another unattended. It was a free-for-all. There was no natural flow through the very large ""warehouse"". You had to wait for every station and then just when it seemed clear that you were next, some small child would run in and jump in front of you. When my 80 yr.-old mother, who has problems walking, saw the situation, she went and sat on a bench and never even got to any of the exhibits. My 57 yr.-old husband was frustrated and bored with the whole thing, cruised through in an hour and then went outside and sat in a chair. Only my 17 yr.-old son and myself tried to fight through. IMPORTANT - THIS IS NOT A PLACE FOR YOUNG CHILDREN. Each station has a set of instructions that you need to read to understand what to do there and then a written explanation of the science that is occurring. Young children won't understand/appreciate this and will get antsy, frustrated or disinterested very quickly. I saw this happening all day long. Having them there ruins it for those that are truly interested. I would not bring any child under the age of 7 or 8. Also, there are only two food options there - an expensive sit-down restaurant (which is not open the entire afternoon) and a very expensive café with very limited food selection. If you want to visit a good science museum, check out the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia.",2.0,"Apr, 2014",

Not even the exploratorium’s fault, unless they at some point start turning people away because #firecode. It just made me hate humanity. Lots of parents were using this as a play place where they were drinking coffee on their phones while their kids ran amok. The parents that were involved were almost worse, since they allowed their little snowflakes to just use the exhibit for as long as they wanted never acknowledging the other kids waiting. My son ended up so disappointed the whole time because he would see something cool and never get a chance to use it.

TripAdvisor,Exploratorium,"While this place is probably geared more towards kids and families with their hands-on exhibits, it's also really interesting for adults. There are a lot of exhibits here - give yourself enough time to explore for at least two hours. Different rooms focus on different themes, like light and color or motion. There are multiple experiments in each room, but usually only one person at a time can do them and there's only one of each. I imagine on a busy day with a lot of families present, it might be difficult to actually get your hands on one. We attended the After Dark event on a Thursday night, which is adults only. This really allowed us to explore and experiment, but again, the place is large and we didn't have time to do everything. I would visit again.

TripAdvisor,Exploratorium,"This place is amazing! SO much cooler than I expected. I'm from Southern California, where we have a place called Discovery Cube, which is what I was expecting this to be. However, this place is SO much better. Discovery Cube is really geared towards children enjoying science, and while this place does wind up filling with children in the afternoon hours, it honestly is some pretty fascinating stuff for grown ups as well. My husband, myself, and our 3.5 year old daughter arrived right as their doors were opening at 10am, and we had the place mostly to ourselves. As you transitioned from one interactive station to the next, you may see one or two other parents with their children exploring, but you felt engaged, and unrushed, and free to explore! Come noon though, and the place had become a madhouse. We did visit the Sunday before superbowl, so I don't know if that is indicative of the crowd, or if that is a typical Sunday afternoon, but by 12, you could really not go anywhere without running into (IMO) way too many kids. When it started to become more of a hassle (kids cutting in line, with no parents disciplining) we decided to take off. Had there not been such a giant, unruly crowd though, we could have easily stayed at least another hour or two. My daughter was the most engaged that I have ever seen!",5.0,"Jan, 2016",

Kids ran wildly from one to another, averaging less than 30 seconds at each. This was the exact opposite of our experience at the The Tech Museum of Innovation in San Jose the previous day (see my review).

I loved feeling like a kid, running from exhibit to exhibit, not to learn anything, just to play. And a properly-mixed drink in my hand certainly did not hurt! Points of interest included the drawing table, the many light boards and video screen which changed as you walked by, the safe in the telephone booth and helping to discover the lock's code at the other end of the museum, and the geysers that seemed to never erupt!

TripAdvisor,Exploratorium,"Exploratorium is a science-based attraction that generally attracts families and school aged children who want to add a bit of hands on educational activity into weekend or holiday time. On Thursday evenings, however, the over 650 interactive exhibits are turned over exclusively to adults (over 18 years old) in what is billed as Exploratorium ""After Dark"". Uninhibited by the tendency to let the children go first, adults, often in couples or groups of friends, are encouraged to let their inner scientist loose. The opportunity to purchase alcohol during the evening probably assists with the warm, somewhat romantic ambience that is created. In addition to all of the daytime exhibits, each Thursday evening provides adult specific programming including guest speakers, music, film and specific themed discussions. It would make for a fantastic first date setting since conversation and laughter flow easily as individuals are puzzled by the wonders of scientific principles. Well done, Exploratorium.",5.0,"Jun, 2019",

TripAdvisor,Twin Peaks,"I walk to the top of Twin Peaks for exercise a lot and I know all the paths and routes. It's possible to walk to the top on Twin Peaks Blvd, the same route that cars take, but there is no sidewalk and the road narrows at a few points and can be dangerous if you're not constantly watching out for cars coming around the curves. A much more pleasant route is to take 24th St from Noe Valley west until it dead-ends at stairs that go under Market St. Right on Corbett Ave and then left on Hopkins, up the hill, and left on Burnett. A few steps farther you will see a staircase that is labeled ""Vista Ln"" on Google maps. Take the stairs all the way up to Crestline, and look for the hiking sign that marks the trail to Twin Peaks. You can go all the way to the top of either peak or to the observation area a little lower. On windy days it's quite horrible (like standing on the wing of an airplane in flight) but sunny days with no wind you will honestly feel like a bird flying over San Francisco.

The Palace of Fine Arts was designed by Architect Bernard Maybeck, who took his inspiration from Roman and Ancient Greek architecture in designing what was essentially a fictional ruin. Although designed only to last for the temporary period of the exhibition, the Palace of Fine Arts continued to be used for San Franciscans. However, because the colonnade and rotunda were not built of durable materials, and were framed in wood and then covered with staff, a mixture of plaster and burlap-type fiber, the structure became a crumbling ruin. In 1964, the Palace was demolished and was completely rebuilt with modern durable materials. It remains a startling architectural wonder to behold.

The United States invited countries from all over the world to attend and China to join.

TripAdvisor,Palace of Fine Arts Theatre,"We were fortunate enough to have a chance to see Aaron Mahnke and Chad Lawson (piano) perform work from his Lore podcast last night at the Palace of Fine Arts Theatre. Just walking up to the venue, from any direction, will leave you in awe. The Beaux-Arts architecture brings you back to the period that encapsulated the 1915 Panama-Pacific Exposition era, and the surrounding gardens soothe the soul. In 1970, what used to be the Exhibit Hall became what is now the theatre. Upon entering the building, you will find a main room/foyer that serves as a home for the small snack/drink and reception area, as well as the restroom facilities. Inside the theatre itself, the seating is divided by even and odd numbers; even being on the right hand side while odd numbers reside on the left. Being in the front row, the only thing we did not account for were the smaller, monitor-type speakers, mounted to the front top-side of the stage. Note: This may pose a problem for shorter individuals attending a seated show. Throughout the event that we saw last night, the guest speaker, Aaron Mahnke, stood in the middle to front area of the stage for the duration of the presentation so the speakers did not cause an obstruction of view. Although the inside of the venue is on the larger side (966 seats), it still seems rather intimate. The seats are comfortably spaced, and recline slightly, so it was a perfect environment to listen to some spooky stories from an excellent narrator/author! Plus, the piano accompaniment provided by Chad Lawson was second to none! Thank you again to both Aaron and Chad for an entertaining break from the norm. Needless to say, we will definitely keep an eye out for more reasons to come back into San Francisco for future visits to this Bay Area gem!",5.0,"Jul, 2019",

TripAdvisor,Palace of Fine Arts Theatre,"Как это не раз бывало, в городах, проводивших большие выставки (Париж, Севилья, Барселона), один из выставочных павильонов Панамо-Тихоокеанской выставки 1915 года был сохранен в виду его архитектурной примечательности, одной из которых был материал, из которого он был построен. Однако годы показали его недолговечность, и в 60-ые годы павильон был снесен и вновь отстроен уже из долговечных материалов. Он несколько раз менял свою функцию, сейчас используется как Дворец изящных искусств. Колоннада и беседка с колоннами выглядят очень внушительно. Кажется, что вернулся в Европу. Перед Дворцом устроен живописный пруд с фонтаном и лебедями. Хорошее место для отдыха от напряженной экскурсии!",5.0,"Jan, 2020",

TripAdvisor,Ferry Building Marketplace,"Our family LOVES visiting the Ferry Building! We missed the Farmer's Market this visit but enjoy the variety of fresh fruits & local products available. One of our favorites is Recchiuti confections- each of us has our favorites and you really should try them all. We also make our stop at Far West Fungi for truffle salt. Tried Boccalone Salumeria, AWESOME! The staff explained the different types of meats, all pork, and was so patient while we each picked out what type of sandwhiches to have! We each tried something different and I think hands down the Muffuletta is one of their #1's. Ciao Bella is also one of our favorites but at 10am we decided to pass on this trip--though it never is too early for gelato! Though it can be spendy there are so many items to choose from there are bound to be a handful of items you will want to try!

TripAdvisor,Ferry Building Marketplace,"I can remember taking the car ferries from Oakland to San Francisco in the late '40s. Always a family outing. The wooden ferries smelled of oil, gas, auto emissions, and wonderful foggy salt air. The the Ferry Building was just that. A place for the ferries to land. Now, the same, but a wonderful food gathering with so many wonderful smells. Next time I may go blindfolded and speak out as to what I can sense. ""Food Court"" is not a good description. It is a gathering place of artisans who skillfully present a single product (coffee, cheese, flowers, chocolates) or small companies laying out, with skill, a variety of things (cookware, books) and family run restaurants. Each places is so well done that one is pulled in to explore, with interest, all that can be seen. It might be cheating, but one might go there and only feast on the taste samples that are offered. To exit East is the Bay with ferries coming and going all of the time. Western Gulls feeding at the rear of each ferry as the turbulence from the props desiccates fish and sending up morsels to be eaten by the gulls. Flying overhead a squadron of Brown Pelicans gracefully plunging into the water for fish. A treat that day was a Heermann's Gull who are noted for following Pelicans and foraging after the fish that spill out of the pelican's bill. Appetite enough I stopped at the Hogg Island Restaurant. Famous for their Tomales Bay (California) oysters. At my age I must grasp at any myth so I ordered six good oysters and a fruit salad. All one would need to eat.

Grazing here is not cheap, but one will find many of the specialty elements that make Bay Area dining so special. I found what I was looking for, dried candy cap mushrooms, and the hubby purchased the best toffee, which we munched as we puttered down the lane. This is a great stop for small and enticing gifts for the folks back home, and a credible location for a romantic sip of wine, delicious small bites, and people-watching.

Highly recommend lunch at either the Slanted Door or its takeout option, Out the Door. Asian fusion cuisine, pretty good in authenticity. We did the takeout and sat outside to enjoy water view -- incredible time. My most favorite counter is Cowgirl's Creamery and its milk bar. You can get all sorts of drinks such as cream soda, milk by itself, yogurt, etc. (the milk's very fresh and creamy) and top quality cheese. Lunch is definitely the theme of the entire marketplace. Everywhere you look is another option to chow, and wherever you end up you won't be disappointed. Very popular with business suits who I assume work in the sky-rises across the street.

TripAdvisor,California Academy of Sciences,"This place doesn't know what it wants to be when it grows up. Is it an aquarium? is it science museum? a natural history museum? really it doesn't matter because it sucked which is sad because i was so excited when i planned to go. Took my hubby, my 9yr old and 11 yr old. First off the cost of tickets is a over priced for what's inside. The place looks big from the outside but there's really not much to do inside. There is the rainforest ball thing as you go in...which Feels like being trapped in a sweaty armpit that you can't escape. literally once you go inside you are stuck walking through the entire boring thing while dripping in humidity. Then it finally spits you out underneath the rainforest and into the aquariums below. This area is the only good part of the entire museum but not enough to redeem it. Then the had an earthquake exhibit that was terrible, a few stuffed animal dioramas, and There is a planetarium...zzzzzzzz! The last straw for me was the food. After walking the entire boring museum I was starving and dying of thirst! The cafeteria they have only sells organic, granola, tree hugger food...which translates into "" tastes like leaves and grass"" Seriously, I couldn't even get a coke or sprite...not even a bag of normal chips or crackers. With kids this is very bad...very very bad! After over paying for the tree hugger organic fake cokes, organic juice, and tasteless organic food... we tried to eat it. (Insert sounds of my children complaining and gagging here) It was so nasty we threw it all out in the end. I will not be back to San Francisco...Over all it is not a kid friendly city compared to L.A. The museums in Los Angeles Exposition park are a thousand times better than this one. The California science center in L.A. is FREE to visit and is fabulous. Then you have the Natural history museum and the space shuttle next door. Not to mention kid friendly food and restaurants.",1.0,"Apr, 2013",

I went with a baby sitting client. We did nothing but stand in line all day. The child was bored. We could not even get into the butterfly room. The so called planetarium was a movie that lasted like 10 minutes. The whole place is stupid and boring for both children and adults. It used to be a wonderful place that I loved. When they redesigned it, they ripped out most of it, leaving only less then 1/3 of the space. They wasted the rest of it with fancy offices for themselves. The aquarium is a tiny basement room with a few fish. The aquarium at pier 39 is much nicer. I suggest you skip this and try Pier 39 instead.

TripAdvisor,California Academy of Sciences,"The museum opens every Thursday the door to a Nightlife event starting at 6 pm. You can pay $12 for the general admission or pay $59 for the VIP tour. We chose the VIP tour and were so glad we made this decision. The VIP tour allows you to enter the museum through the membership entrance, so no staying in line here. Then they take you to an extra area were they offer you drinks and appetizers, which are included in the VIP price. You have 30 minutes to mingle, we were around 30 people, and then the behind the tour started. They guide you through the museum, explaining things about the history and take you behind the scenes. We liked meeting some of the Scientists who are working on different projects and we were able to ask questions. The tour takes one hour and then they take you to the rain forest. Now remember that if you enter on the normal ticket you enter the museum and stay in line to enter most exhibits like the rain forest or the planetarium. As VIP you dont. They took us to the rainforest and we just entered through a different door. Now you have time until 8:30 pm to explore the museum on your own. At 8:30 pm you have pre-booked seats at the Planetarium. By the time we reached it there was a huge line, but no worries you go again to a extra entrance and not only do they let you in from there you get to enter the Planetarium separate and can chose the best seats!

They mostly had aquariums with individual animals and info on them and beautiful butterflies. The planetarium theatre is beautiful but the movie (it seemed more like an IMAX movie than a planetarium show) was the most boring one I have ever seen.

TripAdvisor,California Academy of Sciences,"I, an adult, went alone and loved it. Most visitors are families with children and school groups. Not very cheap (35 $ for adult) but I think it's worth every penny. Arrive early as there is a lot to see. And early in the day there are no lines. First I visited the Rain Forest which is an area that simulates a rainforest with several birds, plants, small animals and numerous butterflies. For those who don't know a rainforest, it's a great opportunity. Humidity and heat are identical. Then I went down to the aquarium and spent almost 3 hours there. The variety of plants, fish, crustaceans they have around is incredibly amazing. This part alone would be worth the visit. There is an outdoor aquarium also with stingrays and other fishs and a roof top. The planetarium is more a 180 degree cinema than exactly a planetarium, but the film is well produced and well explained. For little kids, it may be a little difficult. Sessions happen every 2 hours, so book your ticket (included at the entrance, but you have to book it) as soon as you arrive. The food in the restaurant is quite varied, with healthy options with San Francisco prices, around 10-20 $ with bevarages.

TripAdvisor,California Academy of Sciences,"Visited this unique venue today. It boasts to be the worlds only Aquarium, Planetarium, SCIENCES & Education facility. It is a lot of fun and I’m pleased to say - pretty educational too. It’s $40 per adult which is pretty steep - but as we are on vacation so we thought why not. They do VIP nights and get x2 cocktails and the roof terrace which we would have booked in advance if we had known. We went between 13:30 - 16:00 - as you might expect - there was a lot of kids from summer camps and loads of families. The white Crocodile can be viewed from above and from below the water which is neat. A popular part of the experience. We lost our sun glasses in the aquarium rest room and they were not handed in to list property which was a shame. You can leave your details and they will email you if they are handed in. The planetarium was fun. My partner had never been in one. Greg was our host - along with the voice of Tom hanks who recorded the film we watched in the year 2000. It needs updating - but I imagine Tom has been busy on the Toy Story voice overs and watching English Soccer (!). Greg does talk about 2/3 of the way through with updates which was good. He seemed pretty knowledgeable and offered to answer questions at the end of the x30 min presentation. Plenty of gift shops. If you donate $2000 individually to the institute you have access to a special lounge with free drinks high above the foyer - the room was open so we had a little rest in there. The roof garden is nice - but today was windy and cold with not much info so we came back down. Kids around us said it was like the BBC’s teletubbies ! The aquarium show in the basement had a live feed to the diver in the tank so you could here the conversations - been to many aquariums but this is the 1st time I’ve known this to happen. It worked well. The fish on display were varied. Clean tank. There is a rain forest with giant fish and butterflies. I work in a zoo with a real bat cave and the fruit bats fly around freely. Here there are projections of bats - but the effect was good. You spiral up like being in a tropical Guggenheim museum surrounded by butterflies. When at the top you get the lift down and it goes ‘into’ the tank which is also pretty neat and unusual. We think the centre is a bit overpriced. $30 max for a x2/3 hour experience seems a bit more reasonable. The planetarium is included in the admission but you have to queue and get tickets on a first come - first served basis. There was a virtual reality experience for an extra $12 per person.",5.0,"Jul, 2019",

TripAdvisor,California Academy of Sciences,"Way expensive, $40./adult, but thought my cousin and I would learn a lot, particularly about western geology and ecosystems, but also physics and tech advances, AND learn about space advances in the planetarium. Instead the exhibits were narrowly focused on a rain forest and swamp exhibit - which is what we live in, in New Orleans. And our own Aquarium of the Americas in New Orleans is vastly superior to this one. Instead of space and planet information, the planetarium was used for a film about coral reefs, advising the audience to not eat meat OR sea food, but to become vegetarians in order to save the coral reefs. The volunteer in the ""Africa"" anthropological exhibit gave a nice talk about ""Lucy"" but ended it with a warning that we too will be extinct by 2050 if we dont stop using plastic straws. No physics, no tech, which are sciences last time I looked. The earthquake simulation was the only good thing.",1.0,"Jun, 2019",

One, you get to cruise through beautiful Golden Gate Park and, two, the venue is very very cool.

The Rainforest is absolutely unique and the aquarium is a total knockout, especially walking through the glass tunnel. The folks who work here are polite and helpful. Most seem genuinely interested in providing quality. For folks who have trouble getting around, they do loan wheelchairs here and there are plenty of elevator and ramps. My wife, who was hobbled by a recent foot operation, was grateful for that. We did find handicap parking in the lower garage, but it was still a long walk up some outside steps to get into the Academy. We did get online and tried to follow the directions to use the 9th street entrance for better access, but the roads in the park are labyrinth, so we never did find ideal handicapped parking.

TripAdvisor,California Academy of Sciences,"We bought the SF City Pass to get a discount on entry. You have to have your proof of purchase printed - not just on your phone. So plan ahead. Then you wait in the ticket line. Then wait in line again in the entry line. Put someone in both lines so you can jump in the second line after the first. Parking is free in the park for 4 hours if you park along the road. Beware of this though. We parked and walked in to the museum and then left for lunch and moved our car and then returned and parked again and finished our day. I figured that would work but we got a ticket anyway. Maybe take a picture of your car in the first spot and in the second spot so you can have proof you moved it. Or possibly park on a different road. We had never had a problem doing this before but we had out of state plates and a roof carrier on our car so i'm sure we stood out! $71 ticket. Should have paid to park in their parking garage. The museum is great. If you can only visit one place... go here, This includes an aquarium, rocks, frogs, butterflies, and they even had a bunch of Polynesian dancers do a performance in the center area. - We watched from the 2nd floor and our view was great. The entry includes a ticket to the imax theater but get your tickets when you first arrive so you will get in. It made my daughter sick so she just slept through it. If nothing else it gives you a comfortable seat for a nap! You can take food in as long as you only eat in the food area. Pack a picnic and save the long lines in the cafeteria and the money.

TripAdvisor,California Academy of Sciences,"As a regular visitor to science museums around the country and one who has been particularly spoiled by the quality of museums in my home city of Chicago, I was interested to learn whether the California Academy of Science would live up to my expectations. Traveling with my 18-year-old daughter as well as my niece and her two preschool-age girls meant that we were looking for a museum that would entertain and educate a wide span of age levels. That tall order was more than met by the CAoS. Exhibits here, while not as extensive as the those in the Field Museum (Chicago), did cover a variety of science topics, including animal life, human evolution, earth science, planetary science and ecosystems. Many exhibits are hands-on (always a hit with small children) and the explanatory notations are easy to read, yet informative. The exhibits our group enjoyed the most - and which I have not seen before - were the penguin feeding and the walk-through rain forest. The rain forest was exceptional in that you walk upward through a changing canopy amid hundreds of butterflies. Everyone of us was delighted to see these beautifully delicate creatures fearlessly land on our hands and shoulders. This experience alone was worth the price of admission (which for my daughter and I was included in our San Francisco City Pass). The museum's location in Golden Gate Park is a beautiful setting for a stroll before or after visiting the exhibits, and parking is conveniently adjacent the museum and not unreasonably priced (for those accustomed to big city parking rates.)",5.0,"Jun, 2013",

Since that was about 1/3 of the museum, maybe the price should have been reduced. The earthquake exhibit was okay, but I think they could have done alot more with it. The animal piece was boring - I'd rather go to the zoo. The planetarium was okay. We saw the earthquake movie, and it was pretty lame. The aquarium was by far the nicest part. I did like it better than Chicago's Shedd. However, the way they displayed info about the tanks was silly. It was an electronic screen that showed one fish/animal at a time. Each page displayed for about 1 minute. I wasn't interested in staring at a tank for 5 minutes to see what each fish was.

TripAdvisor,California Academy of Sciences,"As a highly rated tourist attraction we thought we better not miss this and took our 7 year old. It's not cheap, about $39 adults and $29 kids. Sadly felt that it was all style over substance and claims to contain more than it does. The rainforest dome is nice but will take you half an hour max to view, the roof garden is a very small area that you can stand in and look at how they have turfed the roof to save water - you could view this from across the pathway on the 9th floor of the De Young museum which is an amazing huge floor to ceiling glass walled space with magnificent views across San Francisco and it's free. The aquarium is nice but there are many aquariums in California - I hear Monterey is the one to go to if you can. The planetarium was a huge disappointment, it was really used as an Imax cinema to show you a film about trees and dna particles inside things - very little planetary solar images. Penguins - well there are about 10 of them behind a glass wall. It was nice enough but if you come from a big city like London and are used to Science museums/Natural history museums - all with modern interactive gadgets then you may well be disappointed. The building is large but space is wasted here, there was a large central glass room with chairs in that appeared to be where a lecture might be given but was not utilised for anything all day except by a few people eating picnics. I wish we had tried the Exploratorium instead - plus that would have been only $10 adults and $5 children.",2.0,"Apr, 2012",
TripAdvisor,California Academy of Sciences,"This museum seems to be geared to kids ages 4-14. There is a nice aquarium. There is a planetarium. A very cool rainforest exhibit, and lots of “nature” displays. But there is nothing really San Francisco about it. There is a similar museum in just about every city. This is on par with Boston and Portland, maybe not as good as Chicago. This is the kind of place that is good for school field trips. If you are visiting from out of town, I would not put this on a 2 day itinerary. I might put it on a 3 day if it was raining and the kids were into it. If you want hands-on fun, the Exploratorium is better. If you want culture and depth, the deYoung across the gardens is better. Personally I enjoy wandering the park and Haight more, but I am not 12 anymore either. My kids, 14 and 16 were not very impressed, though they enjoyed watching the penguins get fed… for about 10 minutes.",3.0,"Mar, 2012",

There was so much to do we could have spent all day there. Aquarium was awesome, 3-story Rainforest was fantastic, native american art display enjoyable, Snake exhibit rocked, Penguines were my 5 year olds favorite, planiterium was great and show was not too long, There is even more that I don't have room to write about!

TripAdvisor,California Academy of Sciences,科学博物館ようなの展示はあまりハンズオンがなく、剥製や標本と共に解説を読むスタイル。プラネタリウムと特別展（訪れた際は哺乳類の特徴や進化をテーマにしていた？）をみるためには館内の受付で配られる入場券が必要となり、空いていればその日の好きな時間帯を指定できる。3階建てのドーム型の熱帯雨林園では蝶や鳥が放し飼いとなっているため、一度に入れる人数が限られているが、大体20分ほどで入れる。地下の水族館の広さも水族館だけで運営できるほど充実した広さになっており、大型水槽とまではいかずともアーチ型や小分けした珍しい水中生物など展示方法にも凝っていた。,4.0,,

TripAdvisor,Lands End,"Visited the park in mid Nov 2019 and enjoyed the visit very much. My wife and I loved the nature walk and spent slightly more than 2 hours there. There is no rest room along the trail so better use the facility at Visitor Centre before you start.For tourists staying near Union Square, you can take Bus 38r which ends at 48thAve/Point Lobos Avenue, besides Sutro Heights Park. From there you can go visit the park and/or take a walk to Cliff House for a over view of Ocean Beach and Seals Island. Then, walk to Sutro Bath, which used to be a beach side swimming complex. At the side of Sutro Bath,there is a tunnel and in it there is a blow hole. Thereafter, you can walk up to Point Lobos, a platform with a great ocean view. From the platform, you can walk up the steps to Lands End Trail. Except for the initial up steps, it is a relatively easy trail. It will loop back back to the visitor centre (about 5.4 km).

TripAdvisor,Lands End,"Don't pay for a tour of this. The 38R bus ends up right at the National Park Building. There are restrooms available here. The hike is not too difficult, but stunningly beautiful. It is well marked and well maintained. It is a hard pack surface with lots of use. So, as I said, you don't need a guided tour. If you walk all the way to the Golden Gate Bridge it is 4 1/2 miles. Once you get to China Beach, which is not so well marked, the walk moves from woods to mostly city streets and is a bit difficult to follow unless you use your phone navigation. Using the phone it's easy. From Lands End Park Station it is about 1 mile to Mile Rock Beach, which is well marked. The walk down and particularly back up is a bit strenuous; but it is amazing and well worth the effort. When you get almost to the bottom there is a trail to the right going up a hill. At the top of the trail is the Labyrinth, which is interesting and the views from up there are great. Mile Rock beach is great for just enjoying the ocean and the views and climbing around on the rocks by the water. You could have a great relatively easy hike by just doing a round trip from the Park HQ to Mile Rock Beach and back and skip going all the way to Golden Gate Bridge. If you do decide to go all the way to Golden Gate Bridge there is a bus stop and you can take the Golden Gate bus back into most areas of town. Of course UBER is everywhere also. Bus Drivers will tell you if they go where you want to and if not what bus to take. This is one of those must do hikes in the area. Enjoy.",5.0,"Nov, 2017",

TripAdvisor,Lands End,"For 11 years, I was a City Guide in San Francisco. These are free walking tours around the city. Mine was Sutro Highs and Lows: Sutro Heights Park, Sutro Baths, some of the coastal trail, ending at Point Lobos and El Camino. This is a lovely part of the city. From the coastal trail and the el Camino overlook, you get a great view of the Golden Gate Bridge's western side. There is a GGNRA visitors' center in the parking lot uphill from the Cliff House, which gives all the info you need to enjoy this area fully. I cannot recommend this too strongly.

TripAdvisor,Lands End,"I just love this place. My recommendation if you're downtown: take the #5 (Fulton) trolley and get off at La Playa St & Cabrillo St. There's a Safeway, where you can purchase stuff for a picnic. Walk south across Fulton St. to get to Golden Gate Park, where you can visit the Dutch Windmill and the Tulip Garden, and then down on John F. Kennedy Drive and across the Great Highway to Ocean Beach. Walk north to the end, where you can the Cliff House and Camera Obscura. Further North you’ll see the Sutro’s Baths, and then East, along Point Lobos Ave., you’ll find the entrance to your right to Sutro’s Heights Park, right before 48th Ave. When you exit Sutro Heights follow the Lands End trail until the end (northern trails have the best views of the Golden Gate Bridge) and then take El Camino Del Mar back to the Legion.

Finito il trail, abbiamo continuato per la strada che si chiama El camino del Mar con ville e giardini meravigliosi, fino a scendere a China Beach (discesa e risalita facile) e a Baker Beach. Quest'ultima offre la possibilità di fare dei meravigliosi scatti con i piedi nell'oceano e sullo sfondo il Ponte. La scalinata di sabbia per risalire su è impegnativa, ma piano, piano, ci si riesce.

TripAdvisor,Lands End,"If you have purchased a San Francisco City Pass (which I would strongly recommend) use it to catch the 38 bus and ride it until it stops at the Pacific Ocean.

You can sit in the sun for a few minutes and then catch the 38 bus, or go for a walk towards the Golden Gate Bridge (a view from the other side) or towards the south.",5.0,"Feb, 2016",
TripAdvisor,Lands End,"This is the ultimate experience for anyone wanting to see and explore San Francisco's breathtaking, magnificent coast. This walk is a must for all visitors, whether first timers or returning pilgrims. The views from Lands End are gorgeous, stupendous and unforgettable. Allow plenty of time and don't rush it. Stop along the way and savor the fresh air, ocean, rocks and tranquility. Imagine being a hopeful 1849 gold prospector travelling across the world sailing through the gate or a battle fatigued World War II soldier sailing home under the Golden Gate Bridge. Contemplate the skill it took to maneuver vessels on those rough waters into the bay. It's best to walk on a sunny day for at times it can be very foggy, windy and cold (unless you love that!). The fog can roll in unexpectedly from nowhere so be prepared by wearing layers and sunscreen. You are walking near cliffs high above the ocean. It's not entirely flat --- there are some steep parts and a challenging staircase if you walk west to east. Some walkways are narrow, some wide. Some are concrete and some are sand so wear sturdy shoes.",5.0,"Nov, 2015",

TripAdvisor,Lands End,"We did the Lands End trail with our son and his daughter. What magnificent views!!! You get an A+ view of the Golden Gate bridge and the Pacific Ocean at the same time. The Trail itself was not too difficult, but not good for infants and small children/strollers. I would not recommend the entire trail if you are unstable on your feet, but you can walk far enough to at least see the Golden Gate bridge You have the option of going down some very, very long steep steps to the beach, which it just beautiful one you get there. I will say the climb down and up was a killer. My knees were killing me and I got winded. I am 50 and in average physical condition. When you get to the end of the trail, there is a restroom and a place to buy food. You can also walk over to the wider beach, but I was tired of steep stairs by that point.",5.0,"Aug, 2015",

We made our way down the cliffs to these trails and it was soooo much better than being on the normal trail above. I highly suggest you take these cliff-side trails. Much better views since you are not among the trees and you can get right out on the edge of the cliffs. These trails make there way back towards the bay and you can see the GG Bridge. The trails eventually make their way to China Beach, where the normal/boring trails leads everyone. We took the normal trail back to our bus.",5.0,"Aug, 2015",

TripAdvisor,Lands End,"We enjoyed this trail on a beautiful August day. Nothing better when the sun is shining in SF! We hiked this trail with our 3 girls (3,8,9), as well as our 83 year old grandma. I would not consider this trail to be easy, but definitely doable for kids. Most of the trail is dirt, and there are some ups & downs, as well as rocky areas. There is an area with quite a stair climb (100s of stairs). Not too far into the trail, there is a set of stairs to the left. That will take you down to a gorgeous sandy beach area. We spent some time down there exploring and were able to see quite a bit of sea life. There are about 200+ stairs going down to the beach. We did bring our BOB jogging stroller on this trail, and were able to use it for most of the hike, the stairs being the only exception. We did leave the stroller tucked behind a tree at the stair area going down to the beach to save us from carrying it down this set of stairs. The other stairs we carried the stroller up and down. The views along this trail are gorgeous. Without fog, you will get a brilliant view of the Golden Gate. At the beginning of the trail, you will also see the Sutro baths, which are neat to see. Definitely stop in the visitor center for a map, and they are very helpful. We were very impressed with this trail. Parking is free which is unheard of in the city.",5.0,"Aug, 2012",

I kept reading about not going on a weekend as it would be so crowded, but we were there on a beautiful Saturday with perfect temperatures and we found a parking place in the lot above Cliff house and did not feel like there were too many people to ruin the feel of being out in nature.

Just be careful about parking your car as break-ins are sadly a frequent occurrence in the area.",5.0,"Jul, 2019",

And the pathway down to the ruins has like grass and flowers, very inspiring. So you get those 4 moods and nature styles all basically at once, plus the beach, what adds a 5th one.

Then you go through the downstairs rooms, which are about his childhood. There is a lot of reading to do, but there are videos for kids too. Then you take an elevator upstairs to the next rooms which there are several (maybe 8?). There is tons of interactive things to do and more reading. There are also benches so if you get tired you can sit for a little while. Then you think the museum is all done and you're walking through a tunnel-like thing which is all glass and you have a beautiful view of the golden gate bridge..... then suddenly you step into this amazing room with a ramp winding all throughout 2 stories of this huge room. You can't even discribe it, its amazing. Everything is glowing and its truly Disney. Walt Disney's train is on display and a small replica of Disneyland is too. There are some more short videos and stuff and then you are done. The gift shop is really nice, if you collect old Disney things, go in there.

It takes about two hours to get through it all. The only down side is that there is no BART train station near by and limited signs pointing the way. An upside is that the Golden Gate Bridge is right around the corner. All the staff are friendly and will guide you around.",4.0,"Jun, 2019",

I was surprised by how much I learned about drawing and filming and all the new techniques they developed in the 1940s and 1950s. Really fascinating stuff!

It would be nice to have family albums about myself when my life pasts in such a museum, though it is certainly about Walt Disney and not the Disney company.

Starts off with friendly security guard and welcoming staff inside. We had ore booked x2 months in advance. We went straight in and are surrounded by Walt’s many awards including his main full size Oscar and x7 small mini oscars for Snow White. The museum was lovingly curated by Walt’s daughter and family. She has put her heart and soul into the space telling the highs, lows, union disputes and start up of the world famous cartoonist. Some lovely family mementos and personal letters, clothes and gifts Walt lavished on Lilian. There is a Tiki Room Parrot you can have a go at programming, a huge moving light up model of Disneyland, interesting film cels that chronologically catalogue EVERYTHING. The toilets are immaculate. There is a separately run cafe. The gift shop has unique items - limited figurines, books and items you can’t buy anywhere else. As the Disney family parted ways with the Walt Disney Organisation many years ago - don’t expect a Disney store type store. It’s mainly WDFM branded items. It’s great for Disney fans and suitable for the whole family. There is a lift & Ramps making it accessible. There were talks to take part in which were free.

Go and enjoy and learn about the amazing Mister Disney and his futuristic mind. Much of what we have today is due to him .. yes true. I would return again and well worth the entry fee which seemed steep but when we departed we realized the fee was a pittance of what great fun we had,5.0,"Feb, 2017",
TripAdvisor,Walt Disney Family Museum,"I went here with my 24 year old son. We spent close to three hours seeing it all, including a special Dali exhibit that was amazing (but has since moved on.) People should be aware that this museum is big on the history, technology, art, business and personal family history of Walt Disney. So while it's certainly family friendly it's not really a ""kid museum"" per se. The small cafe was nice and of course the Presidio is a gorgeous location.",4.0,"Jan, 2017",

TripAdvisor,Walt Disney Family Museum,"If you are a serious Disney fan (not just a Disney Land lover) or an aspiring illustrator, animator or cartoonist, you will probably enjoy this museum more than anyone else. You will be fed with lots of information about history of the Walt Disney family, as well as detailed description or narration on the creation of each popular Disney character. I do not recommend it as a destination for families with young kids, although there are some interesting interactive activities (e.g. an activity station demonstrating how animation and sound effects were collaborated in the early days) which may make more sense to early teens. I grew up with lots of Disney cartoons but I am not a huge Disney fan. US$20 for adult general admission is way too high for a specialized museum of this small scale. The Disney family is already making so much profit out of their theme parks and entertainment businesses. I wonder why they still need the public to fund their family museum. I will not go back again.",3.0,"Apr, 2016",

Diane Disney Miller (one of Walt's daughters) and I'm sure many others collaborated in putting all this together. It is excellently done and parts of the exhibit are interactive. (I would not, however, recommend this for young children. They will be bored out of their mind.) Since I am a Walt Disney fanatic I pretty much read through the entire exhibit. It took me 6 hours... so there is plenty to see. Very interesting even if you want to skim. And chock full of family history and memorabilia. In one area it also has an amazing view of the Golden Gate Bridge and San Francisco Bay -- ceiling to floor glass. Staff was very friendly and helpful...although scarce in the actual exhibit areas.

My boyfriend accompanied me and, not being a huge Disney fan, said he really enjoyed it and found out a lot of interesting things he didn't know. There are plenty of things that a Disney fan might already know, whether from going to the parks, watching documentaries, or reading books, but the museum offers so much more with its displays and artifacts. The museum is huge, despite not looking like much from the outside, and took us a good few hours to get through. It nicely flows through Walt's family history and childhood up to his death, covering everything inbetween. There are audio clips to hear and movies to watch, but you can go along at your own pace and skip whatever doesn't interest you. By the end, I was crying like crazy over a man who died almost 50 years ago, but was also very glad I visited. The cost is around 20 dollars and was worth it for me. As others have mentioned, it probably isn't great for babies or kids, as it caters more to adults. I'd say take them to Disneyland to have a better time learning about Walt.

It was easy for me to think he just gained success but Walt really had to work for it. You will learn a lot of things personal to his family, look in awe at all of the Oscars and awards received (and some of the great stories behind them) and see all of the merchandise that was created. We had no idea this was in the Presidio and were stunned at the view of the bay. The only slight negative - the expensive gift shop.

You also come to respect his incredible determination and perserverance over the years, despite repeated setbacks. The sheer range of items on display is amazing. Some are expected--dozens of two- and three-dimensional iterations of Mickey Mouse, for example. But others are unexpected delights--like a nine-page letter written to Disney by Diego Rivera, extolling Mickey as ""one of the genuine heroes of American art in the 20th century,"" or a family snapshot of Walt and Salvador Dali! At the other extreme, in terms of size, is a massive, multi-story camera that Disney's team developed, and a scale-model reproduction of the original layout of Disneyland. Exhibits related to all of Disney's major animated movies will bring back memories for many, and those of some of the recent Disney productions will be interesting to young visitors.

Situated in the beautiful and historic Presidio district, this museum pays homage to a man who lived with ""one foot in nostalgia and the other in the future."" The nine galleries showing the progression of Walt Disney's life are beautifully laid out, with lots of interactive opportunities and plenty of family mementos and historic documents. The ""techies"" in our group enjoyed learning about the emergence of film animation, as well as the incredible array of cameras which are featured. (Just the right amount of focus is given to television and the development of the theme parks, as well.) And the ""sentimentalists"" among us loved seeing the family films and the ""Lilly-Belle"" train which Mr. Disney built and operated from his own back yard.",5.0,"Mar, 2011",

When visiting vessel museums SS Jeremiah O’Brien and USS Pampanito, however, I learned that there is no admission charge. What the heck, I thought. This is a muesum of mechanical devices. Think Zoiltran the Fortune Teller. It’s a penny arcade that costs half a buck to operate each device: Skee Ball and pinball, much like Coney Island arcades. Some devices are from the early 1900s. “Laughing Sal” entertained SF’s Playland Park (similar to Coney Island) from 1940 to 1972, as depicted in the accompanying photo. There are photo booths that were popular when I was young, a looooong time ago. Take a walk down memory lane in this fabulous must-see museum of eclectic mechanical devices.",5.0,"Jul, 2015",

My only comment is that a few of the machines didn’t work when we put quarters in but of course there were no signs and we couldn’t find any staff to notify.

TripAdvisor,Musee Mecanique,Saw this on our 1st visit to Fisherman’s Wharf but it was late at night & closed. A week later and at 2pm it was a hive of mechanical wonder. There’s ancient to modern elements everywhere you look. Pics attached. People of all ages can be entertained. The overall feeling of the space is sadly drab & run down. It could look a way lot better. For starters the floor - part 1980’s dirty carpet and 50% concrete. You could spend some $ on it and make the whole experience really celebratory and uplifting - the mechanical toys could be put in date order for example. It’s all a bit of a miss-match. Most games are 25/50 cent a go - so it’s s great place to go on your final day of vacation to wave goodbye to all that loose change. We spent a good x30 mins exploring & playing games - even spent $3 on a photo booth. Some of the vintage view finders and hand made scenic reveal ‘toys’ / wonders are great. It is a treasure trove & worth a visit. I would go as far to say - some items should really not be played with anymore & put in a museum. It’s clearly been so,3.0,"Jul, 2019",

The thing I liked best was seeing the cables that run under the streets of the city. You actually get to see a guy that works there and has to check the cables.

TripAdvisor,San Francisco Bay,"There is something remarkably magnetic about the Bay. As cities go, there is no point in trying to compare the world's beauty spots with the Bay because whilst the view is quite nice, that's all it is, not beautiful. But then there is the saying that beauty is only sking deep because the Bay is an amazing place and calls you back for ever. Tony Bennet is right when he sings about the world's romantic cities but it's San Francisco where his heart is. Otis Redding (in his song of 1967) was happy to just waste his time sitting here. You will see two bridges (on a good day), the Bay Bridge and Golden Gate Bridge. You may even catch a sneek of the spartan beach, the seals, swimmers in the sea, not to mention the souvenir shops, cafes and sea-food restaurants.

Ya hace un año de eso y cada vez que vemos las fotos queremos volver. Fue un viaje inolvidable, muy movido, donde conocimos muchisimas ciudades, disfrutamos diferentes paisajes, y recorrimos calles que nos fascinaron. Desde Buenos Aires salimos hacia Los Angeles con un itinerario que cumplimos a raja tabla (la unica forma de hacer todo lo que hicimos en 15 dias). Nos instalamos en Hollywood a la vuelta del Chinese Theatre y a un paso del paseo de la fama con sus estrellas y sus personajes sobre las veredas. Si siempre soñaste con conocer Hollywood no te hagas muchas expectativas es un poco decepcionante pero tiene también su encanto. Es importante moverse por los Angeles en auto, todo queda lejos. Podes visitar la playa de Santa Mónica y Venice esta ultima tiene un aire mas bohemio, mientras que la primera es de categoría. Si de categoria hablamos podes visitar Beverly Hills y en En Anaheim podes visitar Disneyland. Tambien Universal Studios y programar una fecha para asistir a un programa o serie de TV.

TripAdvisor,San Francisco Bay,"San Francisco es una ciudad hermosa en invierno. Acabo de volver y fue una experiencia muy buena. El clima en enero fue benigno con nosotros y la media de la temperatura fue de 10 a 15 grados y pleno sol. Nosotros paramos en el Sheraton Fishermann Wharf y quedamos muy conformes con la atención y la ubicación del hotel. Sin grandes lujos pero muy bien ubicado. La zona es muy segura y hermosa para caminar . A una cuadra del hotel partían tanto los famosos tranvías históricos (USD 6 dolares de ida o USD 12 para usarlo todo el día) en que se va sentado de frente y que utiliza los mismos mecanismos hidráulicos que las famosas rejas de las carceles de Alcatraz. Recomiendo sacar en la pagina de Alcatraz con anticipación los tickets que salen unos USD 35 dólares ya que hay mucha gente y llegar temprano al embarcadero. También salen del puerto los tranvías comunes que recorren la ciudad hasta el barrio de El Castro. Recomiendo especialmente el paseo por Alcatraz de noche ; parte a las 4.20hs pm y con audioguías en español fuimos recorriendo la famosa cárcel. El paseo dura unas dos horas y luego se vuelve a la bahía con el atardecer y las luces de la ciudad a pleno . Un experiencia increíble. El segundo día imperdible el paseo en bicicleta por toda la bahía , atravesando el puerto , La base militar Fort Mason y llegando al famosisímo Golden Gate para terminar en la hermosa ciudad de Sausalito. Nosotros no pudimos llegar hasta Muir Woods , donde se pueden ver y tener una idea de lo que es el maravilloso Parque Nacional de las Sequoias. En la ciudad recomiendo recorrer las calles del barrio chino, el castro y Union square. Enfrente de la plaza se encuentra un Macys que en el cuarto piso edificio todo vidriado se pude tomar un café con vista de toda la plaza. San Francisco es hermosa y un lugar privilegiado para vivir. No es necesario tener auto. Si el plan es ir luego a Yosemite recomiendo alquilarlo el día de partida de la ciudad.",5.0,"Jan, 2013",

TripAdvisor,San Francisco Bay,"Montar en bici y ver las cuestas de San Francisco asusta, pero no hay mejor forma de recorrerlo y recorrer su bahía que con ese medio de transporte. Una vez empieza el primer pedaleo no quieres parar y ves como vas recorriendo sitios geniales. Los Pier, el palacio de Bellas artes, la playa ¡y ves el Golden Gate!, pero te piensas la subida porque aquí empiezan las cuestas. Cuando llegas allí hay una explanada para que cojas aire si lo necesitas antes de aventurarte a cruzar el puente. Nosotros tuvimos suerte y nos hizo un día radiante, y lo cruzamos pudiendo ver sin niebla ni nubes todo el paisaje que envuelve a San Francisco. Aunque hay mucha gente y no puedes ir todo lo rápido que te gustaría, no importa porque con todo lo que hay por fotografiar te paras a cada rato para inmortalizar el momento. Una vez pasado, tienes que decidir si irte hacia la naturaleza (hay sendas por las colinas) o hacia Sausalito. Nosotros tiramos para Sausalito porque queríamos llegar a Tiburón para coger un ferry a la Isla Angel y fue una buena elección. Sausalito es un pueblo turístico muy agradable en el que se puede coger el ferry de vuelta a San Francisco. A la salida del pueblo no hay pérdida ya que el carril bici continúa por toda la bahía y vas dejando atrás localidades pequeñas, una avioneta en medio de lo que parece un lago (bueno una masa de agua), campos, lugares para descansar a la sombra, praderas verdes,... ¡y todo esto sin que te molesten apenas los coches! Una vez en Tiburón paramos a comer mientras esperábamos al ferry (una pizza bastante rica aunque un poco salada).

TripAdvisor,San Francisco Bay,"San Francisco è da molti ritenuta una delle poche città americane degne di una visita insieme, naturalmente, a New York. Oltre che a cosa vedere a San Francisco e alle moltissime attrazioni, certamente la fama della città è legata alla sua vocazione tollerante e cosmopolita, e all’alto valore culturale ed architettonico che propone, caratteristiche queste che la rendono la più europea delle città d’oltreoceano. San Francisco è anche riconoscibile, o meglio unica, per le numerose colline su cui si erige e per la bellissima baia da cui si possono ammirare degli spettacolari panorami, che sono un puro piacere visivo, pieni di colori e armonia. Alloggiamo all'Hotel Whitcomb, nella parte centrale di Market Street, un hotel storico dato che dopo il disastroso terremoto del 1906 (seguito da un incendio altrettanto distruttivo) fu una delle poche costruzioni a rimanere intatte e fu eretto a Municipio della Città. Stile liberty all'interno, ma non molto pulito e con personale abbastanza scortese. Dalla camera anzitutto bisogna prenotare un traghetto per Alcatraz; è assolutamente necessario prenotare perchè i traghetti sono sempre pieni e non facendolo si rischierebbe di veder compromessa tutta la scaletta della visita. Alcatraz è un’isola al centro della baia di San Francisco famosa perchè ex sede dell’omonimo carcere di massima sicurezza. Quest’ultimo noto per l’estrema rigidità con cui erano trattati i detenuti e poiché sembrava impossibile ipotizzarne una fuga (da qui prende anche il nome di “The Bastion”). Molti nomi illustri, come Al Capone, passarono parte della loro reclusione in questo carcere. Il nome Alcatraz (che in spagnolo significa “Pellicano“) deriva dai numerosi pellicani presenti nell’isola; questa è anche chiamata “The Rock” poiché un’alta percentuale dell’isola è costituita da roccia. Attraversato questo passaggio fondamentale possiamo anche addentrarci nella scoperta della città. Market Street è un po' il cuore di San Francisco: oltre alle numerose linee di tram i taxi sono frequentissimi, ma come prima uscita preferisco girare a piedi. Catene di negozi e centri commerciali, la stazione della metro e, a Powell street uno dei capolinea della famosa linea di tram che si inerpica sui saliscendi della città. Continuando si attraversa il quartiere finanziario e si arriva all' Imbarcadero da cui si gode un'ottima vista del Bay Bridge e dello skyline della città. Il Bay Bridge, o anche San Francisco Oakland Bay Bridge, è un ponte sospeso della Interstate 80 freeway che attraversa la Baia di San Francisco, collegando la città di San Francisco con la città di Oakland sulla sponda orientale della baia. Il Financial District è il quartiere dove avvengono i più grandi scambi economici e finanziari di San Francisco e di quasi l’intera Baia. La zona è ben riconoscibile anche da lontano perché caratterizzata da un gruppo di grattacieli (il più grande dei quali è la Transamerican Pyramid, la costruzione più alta della città con i suoi 260 metri di altezza; è anche caratterizzata da una particolare forma piramidale con base quadrata che la rende un punto di riferimento del Financial District e uno dei suoi simboli più evidenti.), ed è confinante con la Chinatown e North Beach. Il Financial District è la sede di importanti società e banche, come la Banca d’America e la Wells Fargo, importante gruppo finanziario americano. Dall' Imbarcadero prendiamo il tram che ci porterà al Pier 39; il Pier 39 è un vero e proprio centro commerciale ed un’attrazione turistica costruita su un molo ma è soprattutto famoso per la presenza di numerosi leoni marini della California, attrazione per molte famiglie. Il molo è situato sul bordo del distretto di Fisherman’s Wharf e ospita negozi, una sala video con proiezioni in realtà virtuale tridimensionali, spettacoli di strada, l’acquario cittadino (Aquarium of the Bay), e una giostra veneziana che è una delle maggiori caratteristiche del Pier 39. Inoltre non è raro incontrare per le strade chioschi che vendono frutti di mare, tra cui le vongole ed il granchio di Dungeness. Ci spiegano che arrivare al Golden Gate è particolarmente difficoltoso per via del traffico; optiamo quindi per il taxi anche perchè nonostante siamo ancora in estate, il clima è abbastanza fresco. In effetti la Baia di San Francisco ha un clima tutto particolare; l'aria calda dei vicini deserti arriva qui a scontrarsi con l'aria fredda dell'oceano e si viene a creare una cappa di umidità che genera nebbia e appunto aria abbastanza fresca. Arriviamo col taxi al Golden Gate e, per l'appunto, la sua visione è resa suggestiva proprio dalla coltre di nebbia che lo ricopre in parte. Il Golden Gate Bridge è il simbolo di San Francisco. Il ponte è sospeso sul Golden Gate (il Cancello d’Oro), lo stretto che collega l’Oceano Pacifico con la Baia di San Francisco. Il ponte ha il colore “arancione internazionale” ed è formato da 6 corsie adibite al traffico veicolare e un marciapiede per pedoni e uno per le bici.",5.0,"Sep, 2011",

TripAdvisor,San Francisco Bay,"SF Bay is lovely and should be part of any SF travel itinerary via land or sea. My husband and I went for a boat ride around the bay last week and thoroughly enjoyed it. We used the Blue & Gold Fleet tour company. The boat was crowded and noisy, but the bay was beautiful! We cruised under the Golden Gate Bridge, and saw a pod of dolphins just to the west of the bridge. The headlands and vistas west of the bridge are lovely and uniquely viewed from a boat. The bridge itself is an architectural wonder and worth seeing from a boat, as well as crossing on foot or on a bike (we rented bikes on a recent visit to SF, rode across the bridge to Sausalito - fantastic views from the bridge - and took a boat back to SF from Sausalito - that was a great experience). After passing under the bridge, our boat turned around and headed back toward the city, making a close pass of Alcatraz Island. During the ride, recorded information about what you are seeing is piped through the boat's speaker system - as we were outside of the boat's cabin and it was a windy day and crowded ride, we had a little difficulty hearing the recording, but what I did hear was informative and interesting. We had a sunny, windy day when we went. It's almost always cooler near or on the water (chilly the day we went), so be sure to take a jacket and dress warmly if you plan a visit to the water, especially if you plan to be on the water and to stay outside of your boat's cabin. If you want a quieter, less crowded cruise, you may want to consider a different tour company, but Blue & Gold was fine for us (easy to use - no reservations required on the day we went with plenty of tour times from which to choose), and we got to see a lot from the boat. Again, whether by land or foot or bike the SF Bay and Golden Gate Bridge are wonders worth seeing!",5.0,"Feb, 2015",

Удивительно, но о его существовании стало достоверно известно лишь в конце XVIII-го века, когда, например, Авачинский залив на Камчатке уже был освоен россиянами.

Ride from the ferry building up to Vallejo and back. There's no better way to see the amazing diversity in the San Francisco Bay. Take a ferry from the fisherman's wharf area or from the ferry building over to Sausalito. You'll pass by Alcatraz island and the Golden gate bridge. I wouldn't waste my money on one of those circular Bay tours. The boats are overcrowded and they go too slow. I don't think the narration really helps that much. What you really want to do is see the sites of the bay, and take some photographs. But I don't recommend doing in the San Francisco Bay is amateur kayaking.

TripAdvisor,San Francisco Bay,"The largest estuary in the Americas. Ranges in average depth from less than a foot in the south to hundreds of feet deep at the Golden Gate. A 500-mile(!) trail around the Bay is in the works. And history runs through it. The Ohlone saw the Bay arise thousands of years ago as the glaciers melted. The indomitable Morena may have been the first European to walk through it, on his solo(!) trek from what is now Drakes Bay to what is now Mexico. The California gold rush left a legacy of, among other things, massive amounts of silt. The modern environmental and space preservation movements were born, in part, on the Bay's shores in the 1950s and 60s. There are so many ways to enjoy this massive Bay, but it is best seen on foot, or by bike or boat, with a myriad of trails and launching sites available, as well as paid Bay tours and the like.

Views of the Golden Gate bridge, the water, sculptures and the fountains can lull you into a false sense of security.

We exited and found a thief had smashed in the rear window of our new car and had stolen our backpack and camera gear (which was on the floor out of sight). The most disappointing fact was that when we went inside to notify museum security staff and call the police, we were handed a small 5x7 card notifying us that a rash of break-ins were occurring. Had we known this when we were parking - or even paying the entrance fee - we'd have chosen to bring in our bags. The entrance is a long distance from the parking lot. A sign IN the parking lot warning of break-in activity; a security guard in the parking area; or even visible security cameras monitoring this parking lot would be a more proactive, responsible way to demonstrate concern for the safety of museum guests. Very disappointed that a known problem is not proactively worked and that each guest is not notified of the ""rash"" of break-ins. We lost our expensive camera gear and feel lucky that only the car was damaged. Thieves actively working a parking lot such as this can easily escalate to armed robbery or physical violence.

A few minutes before this attempted robbery, I noticed that this getaway vehicle was parked back-in. It was a nice car. Its engine was quietly running, but I could smell the exhaust. In hindsight, it is clear what these criminals were up to. I called SFPD and filed a report. They asked me if I would like to wait for an officer to get there, but they also said they didn't know when an officer would show up. I said I wasn't interested in waiting for the officer, since the person on the phone couldn't tell me what the police officer could do for me or for the place.

TripAdvisor,Legion of Honor,"As members, we try to get to this museum for every special exhibit. James Tissot is an underappreciated artist with gifts that should place him in the upper echelon of the great painters and designers of his time. His portraiture skills are at least as compelling as Singer Sargent's; his seascapes rival J.M.W. Turner's; and his crowd scenes are perhaps more witty than a Degas or Renoir of that period. Overall, Tissot's technical brilliance is on display in virtually every painting, sketch and art piece here. Sadly, the docent who led our tour, while pleasant in manner, added very little to the captions on the wall. It's too bad when docent staff do not rise to the level of the art--the goal should be to help us understand why great art is great in a historical context, but more than that, to help us have a conversation with the art itself, to let it speak to us in the present day.

Every object is given space and light so that visitors can see and savour all that they have to offer. The labelling is careful, clear, and non-intrusive. But it was the light that made this visit so remarkable for me. The use of natural lighting in the ceramics area, especially, just astounded me with the calm and beauty it created in the galleries. Paintings and decorative arts are mixed in many of the galleries, to give the visitor an idea of the milieu in which both existed when they were created.

There is a short walk that will take you to a Holocaust Memorial, a Japanese Memorial and great views of the Golden Gate Bridge. Inside the museum, you will find the works of many masters as part of the permanent collection. I went for the special exhibits. Currently, there are two. One is Klimt and Rodin, two of my personal favorites. These two artists were contemporaries, both rebels of their time, and both created very sensual art. The other exhibit is Color of the Gods. FABULOUS!!! We are used to seeing the sculptures of the Greeks and Romans as beautiful white marble. But those beautiful white marbles were not seen by the Greeks and Romans. What they saw were brightly painted marble. This exhibit focuses on recreating those colorful sculptures based on sophisticated techniques and research. My friend and I spent 5 hours at the museum. We spent about an hour at each special exhibit. We took the docent tour (45 minutes) of the antiquities exhibit. There is no docent tour of Klimt and Rodin, but there was a 45 minute lecture.

TripAdvisor,Legion of Honor,"The Legion of Honor is an excellent art museum by any standards, but having been in dozens of the best art museums in the world, the collection itself, although quite nice, is not what impressed me most.

Walking home we took a trail along the Pacific coast and stopped by the 19th century ruins of the Sutro Baths. The objective of that day's adventure in San Francisco was to see the artwork, but the natural beauty that we encountered coming and going made it a particularly exceptional day. I had been to the DeYoung Art Museum on a previous visit to the city. If I were to be given a choice of which museum to visit, I'd choose the Legion of Honor for its generally older artwork (although mixed in with contemporary art) over the more modern DeYoung, but both are worthwhile.

I knew the name of the show; Intimate Impressionism, so she really didn't need to describe almost every canvas as ""intimate"". She confused Seurat and Pissaro. Okay, a small mistake. But she kept misidentifying the artists and I finally took off my headset and wandered off to experience the show without her help.

The Presidio is also home to Lucas films and Walt Disney's Granddaughter opened a Museum in honor of her Grandfather Walt Disney called the Disney Museum.

Great restaurants like The Commissary and Social Club for dining. There's even a bowling alley and Theater in the park.

Quick tip: one good way to get around and see what's on the Presidio is to take one of the FREE shuttle buses that traverse both north and south sides of the park. One of the shuttles even goes out to the Golden Gate Bridge. When I was there on the former parade ground, other visitors were exercising, playing frisbee, having picnics, and just enjoying what turned out to be a sunny, warm day in San Francisco. Of course, when the bus took us up over to the Park Presidio side the fog was creeping in and the temperature dropped quite a bit. Lots to see and explore and I think it would take more than one visit to do trip justice. I was intrigued by some electric bikes I saw some folks had rented down by Fisherman's Wharf.

Originally an old Army base currently turned into a National Recreational Area and Park was one the highlights of our day in San Francisco. Wide open spaces that gives you great views of the City, Golden Gate Bridge and the Bay itself. There’s an excellent visitors center that gives a great history of past, a cool interactive display in the back of center gives a visual and sounds of the people, wildlife and artifacts of the past. There’s plenty to seek outside either by walking or taking shuttles to and from. For example we made the 10 min walk over to a real treat for Star Wars fans ILM, which is on the property, You can have your picture taken with a statue of Yoda. Following this we walked over to where the old Officer Club is located which has its own unique history and has a great Mexican restaurant Arguello that’s great for lunch.

This would be a great place to start your day, park all day for cheap, and take the shuttle to and from downtown. There is some construction going on down by the stables, but they still kept most of the trail and sidewalks clear. If you want some quiet outdoor time away from the fast pace of the city- I would definitely suggest coming here!",5.0,"Jun, 2014",
TripAdvisor,Presidio of San Francisco,Our chilly December visit was warmed by outstanding scenery and living history all around this outlying quadrant of San Francisco. My intrepid brother's Prius transported us around the toney St Francis Yacht club and checked out the America's Cup race clubhouse. From the Crissy Field trailhead we trekked right up underneath the Golden Gate Bridge at Fort Point. Gene Roddenberry's fantasy Star Trek universe promises that in the far future the Presidio will host Star Fleet HQ as you may have noticed from the films.,4.0,"Dec, 2013",
TripAdvisor,Presidio of San Francisco,"Visit the Presidio! We spent an entire morning hiking from the main parade field along the promenade out onto the Golden Gate Bridge (food and bathrooms available here), along the batteries on the coast above Baker Beach and back through the base. We were here for a little less than three hours and had a terrific hike. Visiting from the east coast and staying near the Wharf, we drove over and found plenty of parking. Many public transportation choices too. Plenty to do and see -- we decided to simply hike the grounds, it was such an unseasonably warm January day and we wanted to take advantage of it. Took tons of pics. Great place to get out and enjoy the sights and the weather. Bikers, joggers, walkers ... all enjoying the place but never on top of each other. Clearly, a popular place and well worth the visit.",5.0,"Jan, 2014",

TripAdvisor,Presidio of San Francisco,"While traversing down West Lombard street we ended up in the Presidio area of San Francisco. I was not aware of the history of the area until we arrived. This used to be a Military base until relatively recent. It is easy to see since the all the buildings look very base like. Since the military moved out, it has become an artist colony and mini city within San Fran. There was a visitor center that told some of the history. There is always something going on, and the day we arrived it was pretty crowded. We tried to eat at the old officers club, but it was too packed so I recommend reservations. It was an interesting stop, with some nice views of the Golden Gate and SF Bay. It might be worth finding out what events they have and going to what interests you most.

So, you may be asking, why don't you drive there? Well, I'll paste this from the Coit Tower site and here's why most people choose to approach on foot...",5.0,"Nov, 2021",
TripAdvisor,Coit Tower,We ended up coming here too early and it hadn’t opened yet. Despite this I would highly recommend you visit since it does offer nice views of the city.

It was a little tiring (and sweaty) but we made it. To ride up the elevator we had to pay $9 for each adult and $5 for my teenage son.

I didn’t care for the elevator operator who was operating the elevator going down though. She wasn’t very friendly and she appeared to have a bad attitude. She yelled at my son just because his mask wasn’t completely over his face. It didn’t cover his nose, and she was real nasty about it. Not sure what her problem was but that was the one thing I did not like about the coit tower. The elevator operator! I did not card one but for her attitude at all.

TripAdvisor,Coit Tower,"The best place for a panoramic view of San Francisco is Coit Tower located in Telegraph Hill. This little gem should be on every visitor and local's must see list. The 210-ft tower is located in Pioneer Park at the top of Telegraph Hill and can be seen from most neighborhoods in the city. The tower was built with money donated by Lillie Hitchcock Coit, a wealthy and eccentric socialite, after her death 1929. Lillie was a big fan of the city's firefighters (like most ladies) and probably would have become one if she wasn't a woman born in the 1800s. Its rumored that she was a woman born before her times as she often wore pants and smoked cigars. Oh good heavens! After her death, she wanted to honor the city and its firefighters by building a monument to beautify the city. Although Coit Tower looks like a fire hose nozzle, the original designers say this is just a coincidence. Her money was also used to build a monument of three firefighters carrying a woman. To this day, Lillie is the patron saint of San Francisco firefighters.",4.0,"Feb, 2011",

As you wait in line you get to walk past murals that were painted by local artists that were commissioned to be painted specifically for the tower representing different aspects of San Francisco in that time. Take the time to ride the Tower to the top it is worth the view.",5.0,"Jul, 2019",

We got luck at were able to park at the base of the hill. We climbed the hill to the steps of the tower and waited in line. There was a lady directing people but there were no signs to say there was a cover charge. We stood in the line outside for about 15 minutes before we were able to get in and then realized we needed to pay $9/person to go up the tower. We then had to stand in another line for over an hour just to use the elevator to go up as the max amount of people in the elevator is 10 people once at the almost top you then have about 37 steps to climb (that was fine for us, but they should let people know as some of the seniors had a hard time with the stairs as they are very tiny and narrow. Once at the top, it is very small and not a lot of room to maneuver. The views however are breathtaking. You can look out any window and see the beautiful city of San Francisco, however they only have one window open per section so you are fighting with everyone else trying to look out the window.

TripAdvisor,Coit Tower,We almost passed on this stop on our self guided tour but on the last day checked it out. Limited parking at the top but two accessible parking spots. Nice views from the grounds even without going up the tower which is 21 stories by modern measure or 13 stories from the era it was built in. There are accessible access ramps to get in to the main level with murals which is free. It is $8 ea admission to get to the top of the tower via elevator but it stops short so you have 20+ steps up to the top from there. At the elevator top they do have a private wheelchair access balcony for a North view. Bay area views are amazing and far better than Twin Peaks so for iconic images Coit Tower is worth the effort. Unlike most city views there are no buildings in the way. Great historical part of Old San Francisco to enjoy and nice high view picture of the twisty Lombard Street to the NW.

We spent about 20 minutes hearing the history while in the tap room, then about another 20 touring the facility. This was a little less interesting, since beer pretty much gets made the same way. So if you've seen it before, you've seen it. But then, back to the tap room for more information from Joey about each of the six beers we tasted.

TripAdvisor,Anchor Brewing Company,"We were looking forward to this tour ever since we tasted their Anchor Steam beer last year. We thought the cost of $15 per person was a little high, but as we found out on the tour, it was worth it when it came to the tastings. When we arrived, we were directed to the bar/pub upstairs and told to wait there for the tour to start. So we waited with everyone else in the bar while the workers periodically came in to get a cold beer to drink (it would have been nice if we could buy a pint while we waited).The actual tour was a little short, but it was cool seeing the cooper kettles they use in the process. After the tour, the tastings began. We got to taste 8 different beer and they were all good. The bar they built is pretty cool, with a lot of beer memorabilia around. After the tastings, they open it up to purchase Anchor swag. It was a great afternoon and well worth the price. They also have a photo booth so you can post a picture to facebook.

I don't have the menu in front of me but these were mostly special brews and a few were staples. I went back the next day and met a man from Poland and we sat and quaffed several beers and talked about the difference between European and American style beers.

The topmost gallery with German works by the likes for Gerhard Richter was interesting, but the lower levels were populated with American pop and other 'american modern' works that could be best described as junk! They were all pointless assaults on aesthetics. The best bit of the museum is the building. Mario Borta's entrance hall is impressive, and the new extension's wavy concrete facade is interesting. The huge green wall feature and the cafe terrace were however closed-off due to 'wet weather', despite no rain at the time. So best avoid on a rainy day altogether. The ticketing staff also failed to inform that an entire level was closed-off, along with some temporary gallery spaces. The staff at the reception could be best described as arrogant, unhelpful, and withholding information that is vital to a museum visit.

TripAdvisor,San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA),"Fantastic museum, both in terms of display and the general architecture of the building. Large, bright and airy, it is a beautiful place to come and enjoy art, or just chill out in one of the many ""rest areas""! With 7 floors of museum to explore, there is an artist and exhibit here that will appeal to everyone, including children, but I have to say, my favourites were the outdoor sculpture gardens. There are tons of stairs to climb, but elevators were available for those unable to scale the 7 floors. I chose to visit only the permanent exhibits, but there was also an Andy Warhol show on, as well as a few other touring exhibits that I by-passed. Make sure to set aside a generous morning or afternoon's worth of time to devote to the art at SFMOMA - if you are at all an art-lover, you will love it here!",5.0,"Sep, 2019",

The galleries are litter free with plenty of staff guarding the treasures..... but here’s a thing - We travelled from the UK on vacation and saw an iconic ‘LOVE’ sculpture on a roof garden. There were a handful of people sat here - but the closest was a security guard on his mobile phone. We asked if he would be kind enough to take a photo.... he point blank refused. We asked why not. He just laughed and shrugged his shoulders. Hopefully you have CCTV of this - approx 15:00 on 7.7.19. - It genuinely ruined our day at the museum. Are the security not given BASIC CUSTOMER SERVICE TRAINING ?!!!!!! - I’m guessing not - maybe the SFMOMA can direct message me to discuss this further. The guard in question is picture #7 on here - I suggest you have a word. If we would of had time we would of queued longer at guest services but the staff were too busy mocking an old lady who had lost her glasses (!) - I’m not even joking. The Warhol Exhibition was outstanding - charting the obvious and not so obvious classics from his back catalogue. Pics attached. This is the 2nd Warhol exhibition I have seen in the past x2 years and this was far more extensive and beautifully curated. Staff member at the end of the exhibition sat on a stool reading a book with little/no interaction was poor. Needs looking at. There are also rude elements of the Warhol exhibition but the only warning for parents seems to be just x10 feet from the rude topic sketches. Some parents were quite verbal in expressing their concerns. Maybe make this a bit more obvious at the start of the exhibition ? - just a thought. - The Warhol shop is expensive overall - $300 for a roll of Warhol wall-paper, $499 for a Warhol BRILLO cube stool, $600 for x3 Warhol printed skateboards, & the odd $22 silver foil thin watch, $30 dominoes and $20 notebooks. The Beach Blanket Babylon roof terrace was disappointing - needs attention too. I imagine Steve Silver would be pretty underwhelmed with what this space had on offer today - don’t you ?Toilets were clean. The main gift shop is MASSIVE and there are helpful staff on standby - $600 clocks, plastic jewellery $15 to children’s books and even light up banana lamps from SELETI. Pics attached. We spent x2 hours here but could of easily stayed for x4. Go and explore. Managers - go and mystery shop the venue and get some feedback from guests - you’ll learn loads if you view this institution through the eyes of your guests. Happy to provide and expand on this feedback. Would I recommend this museum ? - The answer is Yes but it’s a 2/5 rating for the reasons listed.",3.0,"Jul, 2019",
TripAdvisor,San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA),"I went ahead and bought a $32 ticket for the Warhol Exhibit and the whole museum. It was worth it. I'm an art fan, although a little hot and cold on the Warhol scene. The exhibition was well done and lead perfectly into viewing the other exhibits in the museum. I had fun and was ""mind expanded"".

TripAdvisor,San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA),"I'm not a modern arts enthusiast and don't know any of the artists' work on display. I just go for fun hoping to see something jaw-dropping as I turn the corner. The museum was ""standard"". Mostly paintings/pictures and a small number of sculptures/objects on the floor. Nothing ""blew me away"" but had a good time regardless. Yes, they boast 7 floors but each floor is not huge. In SF, land is precious so they had to build up with multiple floors with smaller footprints. It was also stuffy in there as a lot of people were taking off their jackets. Don't know if they had the heat on high or was it because heat rises to the upper floors. Nevertheless, everyone should go at least once for the experience. Let's talk about security based on my observations on this particular day - It costs $25 to get in and while I did pay, I hate paying to get into museums. I think they made enough profit to let me in for free! Ha! Ha! After visiting a museum, I like to evaluate how tight was their security. After you pay on the 2nd floor, most people go to the elevators that take you up to the upper floors. But before you do, your ticket is checked. Quite normal. But on this 2nd floor there are 2 entrances, distanced far apart, that lead to exhibits that doesn't require an elevator ride. The odd thing is that there was a ticket checker at one of the entrances but not at the other. In other words, anyone without a ticket could enter at the entrance without the ticket checker. I saw many unticketed patrons in this exhibit area. Most wandered in there because no one stopped them. Now, in this area there is a doorway that leads to stairs that take you up to the 2nd floor. If you can get past this doorway, you would have full access to the museum as this staircase leads to the paid area of the museum. Ok, yes, they did have a ticket checker watching the doorway but this person walked away for a few minutes at a time, leaving the doorway unattended. As I watched, some unticketed patrons were walking through this doorway, not knowing they are getting in the museum for free! So MOMA SF, if you are reading this, you gotta put a ticket checker on both exhibit entrances on the 2nd floor. I know you let the under 18 crowd go in for free so maybe you don't care if a few adults get free too. I don't know. Maybe you were short staffed that day but you certainly had plenty of security guards watching patrons behave themselves on the museum floors. I'm sure you can spare one to watch the door.",3.0,"Apr, 2018",

This is not that place. The zen garden had been ravaged by an abundance of squirrels (we counted 8 in the sand area alone). They had completely ruined the straight lines in the sand. The ponds were filled with fallen leaves and other debris. Given it was December, it’s obvious there is either a severe shortage of caretakers or a lack of attention to details.

We complained with the same waiter and the guy acted like he didn't know what we were talking about... the other families were white, we are latin, so we can only say that this was an act of racism against us which is sad, because just a couple of minutes ago we had been celebrating and admiring the Japanese culture.",1.0,"Dec, 2014",

TripAdvisor,Japanese Tea Garden,"If you’ve been to gardens in Japan, your reaction to this one probably will be, “not bad, but not great.” Don’t expect to turn a corner and see the Golden Pavilion, a la Kinkaku-ji. However, if you’ve never been to East Asia, this is a must-see. It’s been developed with care and good taste for 120 years. Of the Japanese gardens I’ve been to outside of Japan, including those in Sydney, Singapore and Rio, this is by far the best, Plus which, given San Francisco’s climate, it actually feels like Japan (perhaps a dubious benefit).",5.0,"Dec, 2014",

She told us the history of the gardens which was incredibly interesting, non of which we would have known if we had just wandered around ourselves. I would definitely recommend going on a tour, although they are quite fast so we had another look around the garden ourselves after we visited the tea house.

Once inside, you see some nice Japanese decor and the tea shop (which is pricey) and then the ponds with koi (that weren't very active and looked sick). The Zen garden area was small. The pagoda was nice. The bridge was a hassle to climb. I believe it's for decor mostly because other than that you've got to work to get up on top for a photo and then climb back down. Very steep.

Ein Museum sollte meines Erachtens die Aufgabe haben die Augen der Besucher für die Eigenheiten, Besonderheiten der Regionen zu schärfen. Hervorragend aufbereitet war der Buddhismus in China.

Peggy is one of the ""Ask Me"" docents that were wandering the floor during my visit. She approached me at first and I was just diving into the first exhibits on the 3rd floor but later approached her since I wanted to understand who wrote the large placards at the start of the exhibits as they anticipated my questions (very unique and unexpected). She answered my question and then asked me if I wanted to hear more about the other objects in the galleries. We continued to walk around and view the popular pieces and she provided me the history, background and rationale of the grouping or placement. The vibe walking around with her was with a friend who was extremely knowledgeable about asian art history, world religion and Bay Area gossip related to the museum all wrapped into one.

The whole museum showed a selection of masterpieces from Asian cultures chosen from its vast collection. It was suitable for newcomers to Asian art and probably satisfying for the specialist viewer. The contemporary works were as interesting as the very ancient. The age and condition of some works was mind boggling. The revamped cafe was having a soft opening and was nonetheless delicious. A great salad was my choice. The matcha latte was novel and for me possibly an acquired taste. Look in the shop which has some quality gifts and mementoes.

TripAdvisor,Asian Art Museum,"Our family of 1 tween, 1 teen, and 3 adults visited the museum today to view the ""Tomb Treasures"" from the Han Dynasty (on view through May). Overall, it was a spectacular exhibit and featured exquisite jade, gold, and bronze figurines and common items (like cooking vessels and lamps) that the nobility used. There were also short videos explaining and demonstrating the types of weaponry and forms of entertainment during the Han dynasty. It was mind-boggling to realize that for an ancient civilization existing before AD even began, the nobility had intricate musical instruments and even wine containers. The reason I'm giving this exhibit 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because in the third room, I inwardly screamed ""Ai Yah!"" (Yikes in Chinese). I was SHOCKED that they had sexual toys on display. Shocked that they used these sort of things back then but SHOCKED that I had to think about whether I wanted my children to view such things and ask me questions about them.

TripAdvisor,Asian Art Museum,"Internationally known, this museum is welcoming and user-friendly. The encyclopedic collection encompasses Southeast Asia, India, China, Japan,a little of the Middle East, and Korea, spread across three levels, beautifully displayed. It used to be housed in a wing of the de Young Museum in Golden Gate Park, but about ten years ago moved to the city's former main public library, a Beaux Arts building across from the Civic Center. You can still see the grand staircase of the old library with wonderful art-related quotes high on the walls. A delightful contemporary Chinese sculpture, ""Suspended Letters,"" at the top of the staircase takes its inspiration from some of the quotes. The audio guides as well as the written material in the museum gives a lot of helpful and engaging information, including legends and history. We thought we knew the ""basics"" yet got a lot of Hindu gods sorted out and are now much better readers of Buddhist symbols! We took a break from the galleries and had lunch at the Cafe Asia on the first floor. Despite being a ""cafeteria,"" the room is serene and a pleasant place to recharge. The menu is limited but everything looked good. I had an excellent chicken coconut soup and my husband had a sweet pumpkin curry--although both were delicious and beautifully presented, they were enormous portions we couldn't finish. Each black molded table had one or two fresh yellow calla lilies in a gourd-shaped vase and small potted palm trees created separate seating spaces in the room, making it feel more intimate.

The museums own collection is housed on the floors above. They feature very old pieces but are also in touch with modern Asian art. As they are currently celebrating their 50th Anniversary (2016) there are some special shows planned. The museum has a very strong outreach to local schools so the fun educational element is available for the kids. There is underground parking under the park between the museum and City Hall. Visiting the museum gives you an opportunity the see the beaux art heart of San Francisco with City Hall, Davies Symphony Hall, the War Memorial Opera House, and the Main Library. The area around the library does seem to be a hangout for the homeless. There is also a craft / farmers market nearby. It is close to Muni underground stops. Cafe Asia in the museum is available for lunch (cleanest restrooms in the City...worth the price of admission!).

I have been to equally crowded timed exhibits at other museums where crowded conditions were handled better.",3.0,"May, 2013",
TripAdvisor,Asian Art Museum,"Went to see the Terracotta Warriors and stayed to view the rest of the art that were on the permanent exhibit. The Warriors were really cool, although there were not a whole lot of them. I thought the videos they showed throughout the exhibit were very interesting and informative. It is incredible to see pictures and videos of just how huge the tomb where they were discovered. The rest of the exhibits were good, I thought that the various areas in Asia were represented well in the museum. I spent about two hours in the museum, I made sure to see everything but I didn't really linger at any particular areas, except the Terracotta Warriors exhibit.",4.0,"Feb, 2013",
TripAdvisor,Asian Art Museum,"This museum probably would not be of interest to children but should delight anyone with an interest in other cultures and beliefs. Two hours is a minimum time needed to browse some of the most interesting artifacts. Indian Hindu and Buddhist sculptures seem to predominate, followed by extensive Chinese Buddhas. The distinction between ancient northern and southern Indian cultures came through very clearly in the well done explanations and displays. There were also intriguing sidelights such as a case with ornate carved rhino horn cups (now we know why there are fewer than 300 living Sumatran rhinos living in the world today!), a nice example of a well preserved set of Japanese samurai armor, and carved jade and other semiprecious stone carvings (including an intriguing jade ""wish granting wand""). There was a noticeable scarcity of some other ancient Asian cultures (e.g., Korean) and other forms of art but the sculptures were inspiring and fascinating. Very well organized and presented collection! (Free entry to active duty military and one guest).",5.0,"Dec, 2012",

Da der Garten in Themengebiete aufgeteilt ist und es eine Karte gab, konnten wir uns aber schnell für die Stellen entscheiden, die uns am meisten angesprochen haben und diese besichtigen. Am Abend war es hier auch sehr entspannt und ruhig, was super zum Abschalten war. Der Garten ist sehr ansprechend gestaltet und super gepflegt.

TripAdvisor,San Francisco Botanical Garden,"The San Francisco Botanical Gardens are an outgrowth of the Strybing Arboretum, a fixture in Golden Gate Park for many years. Now, as the botanical gardens, the laudable landscapers and caretakers have added many themed gardens to the experience, e.g., from geological periods to countries of origin for plants. I walk for exercise every day, and I walk the botanical gardens regularly. There is always something new to look at. From the garden of native California plants to the great meadow and fountain plaza, there are surprises around every turn. Something is always blooming, the leaves turn colors on deciduous trees in fall, and there are numerous spots to sit and just be. Take your pick; a garden of succulents to pools of lotus and water lilies. There's even a garden dedicated to fragrances. Located adjacent to the Japanese Tea Garden, both sites can be visited easily in one afternoon. The deYoung Museum and Academy of Sciences are also a short walk away. The botanical gardens offer an island of tranquility literally in the middle of a big city. If you can't get north to see redwoods, the botanical garden's redwood grove gets you up close and personal with the iconic giants. Myriad other kinds of trees are everywhere owing their existence to the Strybing family and the establishment of the original arboretum. One can visit areas of the gardens which feel quite wild and natural, other areas are formal as one might expect. The gardens are free to citizens of the city of San Francisco, but there is a nominal charge for visitors. The variety of living things one can see is astonishing.",5.0,"Dec, 2015",

If this Chinatown was meant to be ""home base"" for Chinese people living in this city, I can understand why nobody wants to stick around. There was absolutely no sense of vibrance as a quarter of shops were closed, and those that were open didn't seem very welcoming with their staggering prices for food and drinks. Souvenir shops were selling Mao-related stuff and cheap toys that made a lot of noise, which I haven't seen in China since the early 2000's. If I had to compare, I would say this place resembles China back in the 80s minus the lanterns and cheesy signs, and has frozen in time since, which is probably why some people to this day think China is still really backward.",1.0,"May, 2019",

TripAdvisor,Chinatown,"From a native's point of view, San Francisco's Chinatown is not a tourist attraction, rather it is a neighborhood. Truth be told, it is a ghetto, a place where the newest immigrants, illegals, and the poor make their home. Yes, there is historic window dressing for the tourists and a unique Chinese merchant-class layered on top of the ghetto, but it is a ghetto in the best sense of the word and a unique sight, with features unlike any other Chinatown in North America. Yes, it is crowded, dirty, noisy, overpopulated, with rude people and ruder storekeepers, with homeless beggars and opportunistic thieves. Chinatown is a different world within San Francisco, and if it hits you the wrong way, recognize that you are experiencing culture shock. for it is a different culture entirely that is on display in this gritty, real place. It is not a Disney ride! The best advice I read here is to explore Stockton St., the main drag for locals, and the side streets that criss cross Grant St. There is good food here, but look for a crowded place full of locals, not tourists. If you want atmosphere, many of the big restaurants on Grant St. will give you a taste of Chinatown, but the hole in the wall places will give you a more authentic experience. If you are looking for a show, or a tourist-friendly Americanized destination, you will not find it here--fabulous souvenir shops notwithstanding. If you want to experience one of San Francisco's authentic and historic neighborhood, come and walk around for an hour or two and bring an open mind and heart.",5.0,"Jul, 2011",

From Union Square, walk to Stockton Street through the tunnel and Chinatown will hit you, full of cafes, restaurants and grocery stores selling fresh produce, meat, poultry, seafood and traditional chinese medecine and dry foods. The atmosphere is electric with different chinese dialects spoken, mostly business conducted in Cantonese.

Parking areas very dangerous, dark, dirty; parking garages hire security guards posted on each level to watch your cars from getting broken into, and parking in garages ridiculously expensive.

TripAdvisor,Chinatown,"Every major urban hub in our country has various areas that are the centerpiece of the diverse ethnic cultures that constitute our unified American culture. It is always one of the pleasures of travel to experience the differences in aesthetics, activities, & of course culinary delights that correspond with this diversity. Anyone visiting a large city who avoids these areas is really missing some special experiences that would generally enhance any travel experience. San Francisco's Chinatown is the largest organized community of Chinese heritage outside of Asia, & it's the oldest Chinatown in North America. Since San Francisco was the primary port of entry for Chinese immigrants & workers during the 19th century, it was only natural & convenient for the city government to designate the perimeter boundaries for the huge population of Chinese arrivals. The core of the development of Chinatown consisted of two factors that created the huge immigration of Chinese into California between 1850 & 1900: the increasing need for unskilled or semi-skilled labor to work laying track for the Central Pacific Railroad as the western branch of the Transcontinental Railroad that President Grant strongly advocated; &, the fact that the city designated an area of land in San Francisco in which Chinese immigrants could legally buy & deed land from the city & private land owners. Thus, a growing & prospering Chinese group of merchants & providers of goods & services to their own ethnic group along with business extensions into San Francisco established the capital basis for a stable integrated Chinatown. The Chinatown of today is resplendent with its own holiday celebrations, colorful decorations, & iconic Oriental designs in both art & architecture. It is a great place to visit, & especially to eat!",5.0,"Jun, 2016",

TripAdvisor,Chinatown,Okay where do I start. I have been coming to the San Francisco's Chinatown since I was a child with my parents. My suggestion is to start at the front gates of Chinatown and walk into Michael's antiques. The furniture and the antiques are simply beautiful and great prices. Once you walk out of there you'll just bumped into so many different stores with different Asian artifacts but besides my favorite antique store you must walk into L.D. JEWELRY. I simply love those jewelry store and the prices here are just incredibly priced. The owner Rich and his wife own the place and they are the nicest people and extremely honest which is rare to find. Now for true authentic Chinese food in Chinatown you must go to R & G Lounge. This place has true authentic Chinese food that is not Americanized.,5.0,"Mar, 2015",

TripAdvisor,Chinatown,"I love to visit Chinatowns wherever they may be and San Francisco is no exception. Start at the intersection of Bush and Grant and you'll find the Chinatown Gate designed by architect Clayton Lee in 1970. Great photo op! I spent almost 4 hours walking down the various streets, hunting for murals on sides of buildings and going in and out of different shops. A great place to take pics - love the colors on Waverly Place. If you want a haircut for $5 go there and you can choose from a couple of different boutiques. Eastern Bakery is on 720 Grant - go and try a moon cake. President Clinton did! Play hide and seek with Ross Alley...once you find it you will find the Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Company! Free samples and a bag of cookies for $3 plus they sell bottle water. I walked all over this place and really got a good workout! Most streets are straight and flat but I found one that was so steep that I think I lost a pound trekking up high! Tons to see and enjoy!

TripAdvisor,Chinatown,"It's been a long while since I last visited San Francisco and Chinatown. Some things don't change (much). Visiting Chinatown should be done as an adventure - you're site-seeing, maybe trying a new food, not spending a lot of money to do it. First off, don't buy something in the first shops you visit near the gate on Grant. You'll probably find the same items farther up Grant for a little less money. Not much less, but still less. You'll find some of the same items in several stores. There are some stores selling high-priced luxury items and many selling tourist kitsch items. Window shop the first, go into the latter. You'll thank me later. Get all your t-shirts here since they'll be cheaper than anywhere else. But check them out closely to be sure you're not getting a second. Walk up one side of Grant, then return on the other. Have fun.",4.0,"Jun, 2013",

TripAdvisor,Chinatown,"Grant street is where most visitors go and see and eat and then they leave. It features most of the cheap tourist offerings. If you want to really enjoy Chinatown you must get off Grant street at least for an hour or so. Stockton has some great family-run eateries and some great places to browse live food stores. See the live frongs, Ducks, pheasents, quail, chickens, etc. View a butchered pig where every single part is for sale. Visit a Chinese herbal store and see the many offerings and learn what they are used to treat. If you cook and want a true experience get some pepper berries or ""Prickly Ash"" for your Asian meals at the herbal store. Try to find that at your home megamart! Sit in the park just North of Grant street and watch the locals enjoy the out of doors and their friends, and family. Grant street has much to offer such as the Far East Cafe and the Eastern Bakery at 720 Grant that has tremendous egg custard tarts and a great take out dim sum you can heat in your microwave at the your hotel.

TripAdvisor,Chinatown,"From what I'd heard about Chinatown in San Francisco, I was expecting a place with grand Chinese architecture, authentic restaurants and lots of things to see and do. I had planned on spending at least half a day here and maybe finding a good place to eat dinner. However, I was largely disappointed. When we first approached the gates to Chinatown, it looked promising. But beyond that, it's nothing but a bunch of rickety, cheap souvenir shops all selling the same mass produced stuff, or shops selling ""nicer"" items at an inflated price (i.e. things that don't say ""I Love San Francisco"" on them). We poked our head in to a couple of shops but didn't see anything that we wished to purchase. My husband found a store selling replica Samurai swords and knives, but it was basically the same items you can buy at the mall here for a lot less (they had a sword that was identical to one my husband already owns, which he paid $40.00 for at a comic convention in our hometown and they were wanting to charge $70.00 plus shipping).",2.0,"Mar, 2013",

( Look down from the gift shop in the tower and you will see train tracks on the roof of the museum). I am sure there are many California architects who love nature and Golden Gate Park who could have created a better design. If this museum had been built downtown with the other museums, it would have enhanced the Museum District.

A different guard told her I'd need to get her up as others could be coming down. Like I wouldn't have done that if there were others. Another occasion, yes another one, a member of staff barked at my two year old for being about a meter from one of the guard rails around a picture, even though I had my arms around her waist. Utterly bizarre over reactions on each occasion. Totally unwelcoming, really old fashioned. Most of the really good world class museums and galleries realized a few decades ago that democratizing access, creating a welcoming environment, not being rude to guests who are t doing anything remotely wrong, is actually not only good for business but is good for arts in the society. Seems like the de young hasn't caught on yet.",1.0,"Jul, 2017",

TripAdvisor,de Young Museum,"Don't wast your time or money on the Summer of Love Exhibition here. Totally lame and boring. Curator didn't / couldn't get license for original music, tons of posters (a few quite fine though), a few mildly interesting photographs that could be seen many other places, but mostly dozens and dozens of fashion show mannequins dressed up in some dull-minded, 1980's rich kids idea of a Halloween costume party, ""Hey guys, let's dress up like 1967"".

TripAdvisor,de Young Museum,"I thought this was borderline painful. The art of the day, which was primarily lithographed posters, were pretty unpleasant.

TripAdvisor,de Young Museum,"The de Young is paired with the Legion of Honor as one of the two ""Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco"" (FAMSF). The Legion of Honor specializes in European art from the middle ages to the 20th century, while the de Young displays Native American, African, Oceanic, and settler American art. A bit of scandal erupted in 2012 after the flamboyant, populist director of FAMSF died. In the uncomfortable transition, several staff members were fired or left. A March 15, 2013, article in the NY Times spoke of ""turmoil"" at FAMSF, centered on the controversial chair of the trustees, a wealthy philanthropist. Since then a more scholarly director has been appointed who has been building up the collection and trying to restore the prestige of the museums. My sense after my recent visit to both museums is that, despite having a common director, they have very different approaches and cultures. At the Legion of Honor, the art on display is taken from the whole breadth of culture -- not just paintings but also furniture, tapestries, religious objects, jewelry, tea sets, books, wall decorations, clothing, etc. Art at the Legion of Honor is interpreted in a pretty traditional way in terms of form, technique, and meaning. The de Young, by contrast, doesn't seem to have so much patience for this traditional approach to the European canon. It tries to expand horizons with African, Native American, and Oceanic objects, which, however, too often seemed to be presented as anthropological artifacts, abstracted from their lived context, and reflecting ostensibly primitive symbol systems that little placards tried to explain. (But there's also more recent art by Native Americans which isn't distanced in this way.) With the settler art, the permanent exhibitions at the de Young focused on elite museum art, and were pretty light on more popular forms (commercial art, comic books, photography, religious art, illustrations for children's books, editorial cartoons, magazine covers, popular film, computer graphics, etc.). The posted interpretations seemed to have been written by an opinionated post-modern intellectual keen to alert visitors to contested identities, reinterpreted narratives, and the limitations of traditional media. I went away feeling that both museums needed a bit of shaking up. I thought they worked too hard at trying to get visitors to see things as curators see things, and not hard enough at helping visitors connect with the artists' creative spirit.",4.0,"Jan, 2015",

TripAdvisor,de Young Museum,When we visited thee was a Gaugin exhibition which was free - not one of my favourite artists but an excellent collection of his work.

Buying our ticket at this art museum with no one else in line - one of the worst experiences we have had in a long time.

At de Young, the distinction blurs. Is a brilliantly decorated bowl used to serve food 2,000 years ago art or craft? “de Young” part of this museum contains Chihuly art-glass bowls and patters.

Not only is it an inconsistent policy (women wearing purses are not subjected to this loudly announced dictate), but I am never close to any artwork. The logic is that the backpack might fly off my shoulder and push the art work. Holding such items makes them much more heavy. Putting them on the floor means bending over to pick them consistently. For those who have disabilities or various pain, the practice is not conducive. We don't drive to the museum with the parking issues. Therefore, the policy is simply problematic.

TripAdvisor,de Young Museum,"Ramses the Great and the Gold of the Pharaohs: After having an unsatisfying experience seeing this exhibition at the de Young and wanting to write a review I looked for other reviews and found a few statements that almost perfectly addressed my major concerns [albeit I’ve adjusted the quotes to reflect my opinion rather than the opinion of the original author]: “…a (supposedly) dazzling presentation comes at the cost of curatorial substance, it’s not only disappointing, it fails to honor the subject.” … or to significantly inform, albeit for some it may entertain. “…It can be almost theme-park-like, (NOT) in the best possible way….”. Additionally, it was over-crowded, and, the essentially forced-bunching of people together for the “dazzling presentations/immersive experiences” only made the crowding issue worse (and this is not in terms of Covid/pre-Covid but simply in terms of layout and crowding when trying to view museum displays). And finally, the over-hyping within the presentations was disappointing if for no other reason then it demonstrated the curatorial inability to present the actual subject material which focused on a ruler who in reality was the equal of Trump in self-promotion – the “silly” presentation overshadowed the actual subject matter.",2.0,"Dec, 2022",
TripAdvisor,de Young Museum,"Actually, we saw the Ramses exhibit along with the rest of the museum and we were pleasantly surprised by both. The exhibit was great. We have seen quite a few Egyptian exhibits plus the regular collections at many museums, including the one at the University of Pennsylvania, a personal favorite for sentimental reasons. I went there. Some bias showing. Although the dedicated Turin museum in Italy is hands-down the best I have seen by a long shot. I had read reviews and heard its praises, but the real kicker is the absolute passion of Italians who have seen it, particularly citizens of the city. There is mind boggling pride that they have what is regarded as the second best Egyptian museum in the world after the one in Cairo. In fact, if I could remember half of what I have seen and read in the museums, let alone Imax movies, TV shows, articles, etc. I could be an amateur Egyptian historian. Alas, I cannot remember 1/50th. What I can say is that like the Romans, the more you learn about this remarkable civilization, the more impressed you are. Considering they pre-date the Romans by almost two millenia and lasted even longer than the Romans ( although if you include the Byzantine empire, not by much), you have to say that they are the most impressive civilization in the history of man ( the Chinese may contest that ). Getting back to the exhibit, they had some really great pieces and it was interestingly assembled and presented. We spent a lot more time than I ever anticipated we would. Indeed, I liked it so much, I took a quick run through to see it getting back to the start and coming back to the end, where my wife patiently waited. Heck, she needed the rest, anyway. For me, I thought the rest of the museum was a throwaway. I did not think they would have much of a collection and would never have considered seeing it without the Ramses exhibit. This is perhaps our fifth visit to SF and I never gave it a second thought before, including this time until I saw an ad or something about the exhibit and I said to my wife, “Let’s go.” Good thing. The museum itself is great. The collections are of a high caliber and interesting. Again, we spent far more time on that than I ever imagined and I could have spent more. A special shout-out to the restaurant has to be made. This is a particularly good example of the genre. Light and airy, with pleasant views of the outside almost park-like setting and the food was very, very good. My wife and I had very good beef short ribs with vegetables and two excellent desserts and drinks. I didn’t even mind the exorbitant $85 tab. Our taxi cab driver coming home said that for SF that was a tremendous bargain. Speaking of taxis, the ride from our hotel, the very good Hotel Zoe Fishermans Wharf, was like $35 with tip. Between the two taxi rides, tickets to the museum, lunch and various stuff purchased in the gift shop, it was a very expensive museum outing, probably the most expensive we have had. If you add on the jaunt through the Japanese garden with the obligatory magnet purchase and the ride on the ferris wheel and the even more obligatory $8 dipped cone purchase from a truck parked nearby, it was one of the more expensive days in our extensive travels. And even though I am frugal by nature, I didn’t mind. It was one of the most satisfying and fullest days of the trip. Perhaps the best. In conclusion, go to the de Young Museum and go now before the Ramses exhibit closes. It would be a shame to miss it.",5.0,"Dec, 2022",

TripAdvisor,Ghirardelli Square,"We visited Ghirardelli Square during our last couple hours in SF to take our kids to get ice cream. It was mid-morning and there were tons of people around. Unfortunately, when we returned to our rental car an hour later, we found the windows smashed out and all our children's backpacks stolen. We were stunned-- this is a major tourist area, and we were parked on a busy street on a corner with a security camera pointed directly at our parking space. But what we learned when we called the police, and from the many, many locals who stopped to talk to us as we cleaned up the glass, is that this is a very common occurrence there. There are actually small signs taped on the parking meters that warn that ""this area is a target for break-ins"" (we missed that). I know-- stupid tourists, didn't realize thieves would smash out windows in front of witnesses on a busy corner at 11:30 AM to steal children's toys. The police would only take a report over the phone and wouldn't come out or even review the security camera footage. Fortunately, a good Samaritan on a bike helped us look around and he found our abandoned bags five blocks away, with my 9-year-old son's iPad, some money, and a camera missing. It was DEFINITELY not worth it just to go to the flagship Ghirardelli ice cream parlor, where they serve you ice cream in plastic cups and you have to fetch your own water. I realize this review may not go over well with some people, but you can see this is not what I normally post on this site and I want to warn other tourists that Ghirardelli Square is a target for thieves (as evidenced by the signs on the meters, not just my anecdotal experience), is not attended to by police (as many locals informed us), and is not an area where ANYONE should be parking with out-of-state tags or rental car identifiers. I am attaching a photo of my happy children standing by our parking space at the Ghirardelli building after our bags were recovered by the good Samaritan. The only child not smiling is my 9-year-old whose iPad was stolen from his backpack with a stuffed monkey pillow attached to it. Great last experience in San Francisco.

We were in a corner and the kids kept getting pushed and hit by staff and customers. The staff was rude. When we got our food the guy asked if we wanted chairs. Euh well yes?! No I'm going to get my sundae standing with two small children! Good grief. Got two chairs and had the kids on our laps. The entire time people kept bumping into us while eating.

I nearly always see pelicans here and often it is relatively quiet, especially out of season. You MUST be careful of your belongings here though and signs in the car park tell you to secure your car and to remove valuables. Luckily I have never had issues myself but even on this trip there was a car parked close to mine that had a smashed rear window and the seat into the boot (trunk) had been dropped down.

TripAdvisor,Baker Beach,"Visited this beach 3 times in 2017 when in San Fran on work. The nude area is at the North end and starts roughly where the sand ladder is but there are no signs – if you see lots of nude people you are in the nudist area :-) It is very popular with locals but is also easy to get to even for tourists (1 hour - bus + short walk from San Fran Financial district). The “back drop” is a fantastic view of the Golden Gate Bridge and is very popular with sight seers coming to take photos (of the Bridge not the nudists); a lot are clearly shocked/uncomfortable when they realise that this tourist attraction is full of nude people but they have no option but to ignore them. The beach is sandy with either dunes behind or cliff at the very Northern end; the majority of the Beach to the South is the textile area and gets very busy, this is where the parking and toilets are. I have only been on week days and the crowd was mainly male retired but there were some females and some in their twentys.

TripAdvisor,Baker Beach,"Good view of the bridge from here , but the closer you get the more old man flesh you start to see, not surprising that those who choose to go without clo#ths are men on there own and let me say that if I was build that small I wouldn't want to show it off. I would urge caution with younger children, parking was very easy for us, but i can image it getting packed, toilets ts onsite , were very grim, smell of pot waving down, sea was rough and should not be attempted to swim in, keep an eye out for toddlers wading in, they disappear very easily.",3.0,"Oct, 2019",

TripAdvisor,Baker Beach,"Una de las mejores fotos que puedes tener del puente, es desde esta playa. La playa es bonita, pero la belleza es la conjugación de playa más puente. Fuimos al atardecer y es bonito, aunque como en muchas otras playas, pero poder disponer de la visión del puente y la gente caminando a medida que cambian las luces del día es algo que no se puede disfrutar en cualquier playa. Fuimos andando pero hay un parking cerca bastante amplio y gratuito. Había leido que al menos desde el último año se habían sucedido rotura de cristales para robar el interior de los vehículos, asi que procurad no dejar nada a la vista si vais en coche. sino como en nuestro caso vas a pie, tienes un trecho para encontrar parada de medio de transporte y no hay sitios cercanos donde comprar bebida o comida. O al menos, yo no los vi en mi visita. No parece que sea peligroso ir de noche, pero tendrás que ir por el arcén de una carretera habilitada para peatones que está poco frecuentada, salvo algún corredor o quizá algún turista como nosotros.",5.0,"Aug, 2019",

TripAdvisor,Baker Beach,"Baker Beach, ubicada junto al Golden Gate, ofrece (a mi juicio) las mejores vistas del Ícono de San Francisco. La playa en sí no me parece que tenga un gran atractivo. Observar a los turistas tratando de acceder a la playa bajando por los empinados cerros es todo un espectáculo (señores/as: hay escaleras, sigan la señalización!). La playa principal es muy tranquila (justo bajando las escaleras de acceso), más allá, y pasando unos roqueríos hacia el Golden Gate Bridge, hay una zona algo más pequeña que cuando sube la marea hace desaparecer la playa.

TripAdvisor,Baker Beach,"Simply awesome views. We went over after walking part way across the G.G. bridge. It feels like you are very far from civilization, even though there were a few other people around, but it certainly is far from crowded. We stayed at the top of the cliffs and saw the beach below. We were a bit too tired by then to walk down to the beach. We could tell there were naked people walking below which was interesting. :)",4.0,"Oct, 2017",
TripAdvisor,Baker Beach,We had an Uber drop us at Baker Beach. We walked on the sand towards the Golden Gate Bridge. It was a beautiful warm sunny day and views of the Bridge were excellent.

We climbed up the trail from North Baker Beach (a very steep hill) to walk to the Bridge along the trail along Lincoln Blvd and Merchant Road.,5.0,"Oct, 2017",
